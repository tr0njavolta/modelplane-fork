# Writing Crossplane v2 Python Composition Functions

## The Function Contract

Each function is a hatch-buildable Python package under `functions/{name}/`.
The composition logic lives in `function/compose.py` and exports:

```python
from crossplane.function.proto.v1 import run_function_pb2 as fnv1

def compose(req: fnv1.RunFunctionRequest, rsp: fnv1.RunFunctionResponse):
    pass  # Mutate rsp in place. Don't return anything.
```

Do NOT call `response.to(req)` in compose(). Do NOT return `rsp`. The
`fn.py` boilerplate handles creating the response and calling compose().

Each function directory has this structure:
```
functions/my-function/
├── pyproject.toml          # Declares deps on crossplane-models, modelplanelib, SDK
├── function/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── __version__.py
│   ├── main.py             # CLI entrypoint (boilerplate)
│   ├── fn.py               # FunctionRunner gRPC service (boilerplate)
│   └── compose.py          # The actual composition logic
```

See [references/example.py](references/example.py) for a complete example
function demonstrating all key patterns: Pydantic models, gating, readiness,
events, status, deletion ordering.

Use `crossplane function generate` to scaffold new functions.

## Build Cycle

```bash
# 1. Write XRD (apis/myresource/definition.yaml)
# 2. Write composition (apis/myresource/composition.yaml)
# 3. Build to generate Pydantic models
crossplane project build
# 4. Write the function (functions/compose-myresource/function/compose.py)
# 5. Write test (tests/test_myresource.py)
# 6. Build again, then test
crossplane project build
python3 -m pytest tests/test_myresource.py -v
```

Build before writing the function — it generates Pydantic models under
`schemas/python/models/` that the function imports.

### How the Build Works

`crossplane project build` builds each function using Docker. For Python
functions, it runs `hatch build` in a Debian container to produce a wheel,
installs it into a fresh venv, then appends that venv as a layer on top of
a distroless Python base image. The result is written to an `.xpkg` file
under `_output/`.

This means:
- Functions are real Python packages with `pyproject.toml` and declared deps
- Third-party packages (e.g. pyyaml) can be added as dependencies
- The shared library `modelplanelib` is installed via path dependency

### Deploying Changes to a Cluster

Each build produces new digests for changed functions. The Configuration's
dependency metadata includes these digests. Updating the Configuration tag
is sufficient — Crossplane sees the new digests and updates the Functions
automatically:

```bash
nix run .#build-crossplane
nix run .#push-crossplane              # auto-generates v0.1.0-dev.<count>.g<hash>
kubectl patch configuration <name> --type=merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"package":"xpkg.upbound.io/<org>/<project>:<tag>"}}'
```

The push command auto-generates a unique dev tag from git metadata
(commit count + short hash). Pass `-- --tag v1.0.0` to override.

Three commands, no Function deletion needed. Crossplane handles the rest
via digest comparison in the ConfigurationRevision's dependencies.

## Import Paths

Pydantic models are generated under `schemas/python/models/` and installed
as the `crossplane-models` package. Import them as `models.X`:

```python
from models.io.crossplane.m.helm.release import v1beta1 as helmv1beta1
from models.io.crossplane.m.kubernetes.object import v1alpha1 as k8sobjv1alpha1
```

The shared library is installed as `modelplanelib`:
```python
from modelplanelib import conditions, metadata, naming
from modelplanelib import resource as libresource
```

When in doubt, check what exists under `schemas/python/models/`.

XR models have no `.m.` segment:
```python
from models.ai.modelplane.modeldeployment import v1alpha1
```

## Composing Resources

Use Pydantic models for everything with a generated model — they catch field
name mistakes at write time:

```python
resource.update(
    rsp.desired.resources["network"],
    networkv1beta1.Network(
        spec=networkv1beta1.Spec(
            forProvider=networkv1beta1.ForProvider(
                project="my-project",
                autoCreateSubnetworks=False,
            ),
        ),
    ),
)
```

Raw dicts are the fallback for CRDs without generated models (Gateway API,
MetalLB, Usages, etc.):

```python
resource.update(rsp.desired.resources["gateway-class"], {
    "apiVersion": "gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1",
    "kind": "GatewayClass",
    "metadata": {"name": "envoy"},
    "spec": {"controllerName": "gateway.envoyproxy.io/gatewayclass-controller"},
})
```

### Protobuf Number Coercion

All numbers from XRD fields arrive as Python `float`, not `int`. Cast
explicitly:

```python
desired_envs = int(xr.spec.environments)  # protobuf delivers as float
```

## Readiness

Set XR readiness via `rsp.desired.composite.ready`:

```python
rsp.desired.composite.ready = fnv1.READY_TRUE
```

Do NOT set the `Ready` condition via `fnv1.Condition` — it's reserved. Do NOT
use `TARGET_COMPOSITE_AND_CLAIM` — there are no claims in Crossplane v2.

For composed resources, check the appropriate condition (not always `Ready`):

```python
from crossplane.function import resource

def _has_condition(req, name, cond):
    """Check if an observed composed resource has a condition set to True."""
    observed = req.observed.resources.get(name)
    if observed is None:
        return False
    return resource.get_condition(observed.resource, cond).status == "True"

# Crossplane MRs use Ready
if _has_condition(req, "my-cluster", "Ready"):
    rsp.desired.resources["my-cluster"].ready = fnv1.READY_TRUE

# Gateway API uses Accepted
if _has_condition(req, "my-gateway", "Accepted"):
    rsp.desired.resources["my-gateway"].ready = fnv1.READY_TRUE
```

Resources without conditions (ProviderConfigs, ConfigMaps) should be marked
always-ready:

```python
rsp.desired.resources["my-providerconfig"].ready = fnv1.READY_TRUE
```

## Results as Kubernetes Events

`response.normal()` and `response.warning()` emit Kubernetes events visible
in `kubectl describe`. Use them deliberately:

- **Normal (every reconcile, time-bounded):** "Waiting for: gke-cluster" —
  expected, self-resolving. Stops when the resource becomes ready.
- **Normal (transition, once):** "GKE cluster ready, composing KServeStack" —
  milestone. Detect transitions by comparing current state to observed state.
- **Warning (every reconcile, persistent):** "spec.kserve.cluster.gke is
  required" — user-actionable, won't self-resolve.

Detect transitions:
```python
was_ready = resource.get_condition(
    req.observed.composite.resource, "Ready"
).status == "True"

if not not_ready:
    rsp.desired.composite.ready = fnv1.READY_TRUE
    if not was_ready:
        response.normal(rsp, "Ready, gateway: 34.55.233.135")
else:
    response.normal(rsp, f"Waiting for: {', '.join(not_ready)}")
```

Never emit Normal events on every reconcile in the steady state — they
accumulate as Kubernetes Event objects.

## Gating Resources on Dependencies

Only compose a resource when its dependencies are observed. But once composed,
always keep emitting it — if a function omits a resource from desired state,
Crossplane deletes it.

```python
pc_observed = "provider-config" in req.observed.resources
release_exists = "cert-manager" in req.observed.resources

# Gate on dependency, but always emit once it exists
if pc_observed or release_exists:
    resource.update(rsp.desired.resources["cert-manager"], ...)
```

For readiness-based gating (e.g., KServe waits for cert-manager):

```python
cert_ready = _has_condition(req, "cert-manager", "Ready")
kserve_exists = "kserve" in req.observed.resources

if cert_ready or kserve_exists:
    resource.update(rsp.desired.resources["kserve"], ...)
```

## Required Resources (Cross-XR Reads)

Use required resources to read resources the function doesn't own:

```python
from crossplane.function import request, response

response.require_resources(
    rsp, name="cluster",
    api_version="platform.example.org/v1alpha1",
    kind="Cluster",
    match_name="my-cluster",
)

cluster = request.get_required_resource(req, "cluster")
if cluster is None:
    return  # Crossplane will re-call with the resource
```

Required resources are dicts, not Pydantic models — they're external resources
resolved by Crossplane.

The empty `match_labels={}` selector is broken — protobuf serialization loses
the empty map, causing the `oneof match` to be unset. Use a real label to match
on, or use `match_name` for specific resources.

## Deletion Ordering with Usages

When a composite is deleted, all composed resources get deletion timestamps
simultaneously. Resources with implicit dependencies (ProviderConfigs used by
Helm releases, clusters used by stacks installed on them) need explicit ordering.

Use `protection.crossplane.io/v1beta1` Usages:

```python
resource.update(rsp.desired.resources["usage-pc-by-release"], {
    "apiVersion": "protection.crossplane.io/v1beta1",
    "kind": "Usage",
    "metadata": {"namespace": "my-namespace"},
    "spec": {
        "of": {
            "apiVersion": "helm.m.crossplane.io/v1beta1",
            "kind": "ProviderConfig",
            "resourceRef": {"name": "my-provider-config"},
        },
        "by": {
            "apiVersion": "helm.m.crossplane.io/v1beta1",
            "kind": "Release",
            "resourceSelector": {
                "matchControllerRef": True,
                "matchLabels": {"my-label": "my-release"},
            },
        },
        "replayDeletion": True,
    },
})
```

Key rules:

- **One Usage per protected-by pair.** The selector resolves to the first
  matching resource and stops. Two releases need two Usages with distinct labels.
- **Use labels to distinguish resources** of the same kind in the selector.
- **`replayDeletion: True`** means: when the "by" resource is deleted, delete
  the Usage, then retry deleting the "of" resource.
- **Usages don't prevent Terminating state.** A namespace with a
  `deletionTimestamp` blocks new object creation even if a Usage prevents its
  final deletion. Use shared long-lived namespaces instead of per-resource
  namespaces.

## managementPolicies for Undeletable Resources

Some resources can't be cleanly deleted (webhook-protected CRDs, resources with
controller-managed finalizers). Use `managementPolicies` to skip deletion:

```python
release.spec.managementPolicies = ["Create", "Observe", "Update"]
```

This is appropriate when the underlying infrastructure is being destroyed anyway
(e.g., KServe on a GKE cluster that's being deprovisioned). The resource is
orphaned and destroyed with the cluster.

## Cluster-Scoped XRs Composing Namespaced Resources

Cluster-scoped XRs don't auto-populate `metadata.namespace` on composed
namespaced resources. Set it explicitly:

```python
helmv1beta1.Release(
    metadata=metav1.ObjectMeta(namespace="my-namespace"),
    spec=...,
)
```

Without this, the resource has no namespace in the XR's `resourceRefs` and
Crossplane can't GET it.

## Debugging

When something is slow or stuck during deletion, describe the resources:

```bash
kubectl describe <resource> -n <namespace>
```

Every "slow" deletion has a specific stuck resource with a specific error.
Common causes:

- **ProviderConfig not found:** deleted before the resources that use it. Fix
  with a Usage.
- **Namespace is terminating:** blocks ProviderConfigUsage creation. Fix by
  using a shared namespace.
- **Webhook has no endpoints:** the webhook server pod was deleted before the
  webhook-protected resources. Fix with `managementPolicies`.
- **Finalizer blocking deletion:** a remote controller hasn't processed the
  deletion yet (e.g., GatewayClass `gateway-exists-finalizer`). Fix with
  `managementPolicies` or a Usage to ensure the dependent is deleted first.

Never increase timeouts without first describing the stuck resources. The fix
is always in the deletion ordering, not the timeout.
