# Modelplane — Design Document

**Status:** Draft
**Date:** May 2026
**Author:** Nic Cope

## Executive summary

Modelplane is an open-source, fleet-level inference control plane built on
Crossplane. It manages GPU clusters across clouds and regions, schedules model
deployments across the fleet, and routes inference traffic through a unified
gateway. An ML team deploys a model like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: modelplane.ai/v1alpha1
kind: ModelDeployment
metadata:
  name: kimi-k2
  namespace: ml-team
spec:
  clusterSelector:
    matchLabels:
      modelplane.ai/tier: production
  replicas: 1
  nodeSelector:
    cel: |
      capacity["gpu.nvidia.com/memory"].compareTo(quantity("141Gi")) >= 0 &&
      attributes["gpu.nvidia.com/features"].includes("fp8") &&
      attributes["modelplane.ai/networkInterNode"].string == "infiniband"
  workers:
    topology:
      strategy: TensorPipeline
      tensor: 8
      pipeline: 2
  engine:
    name: vLLM
    image: vllm/vllm-openai:v0.8.5
    args:
    - "--model=moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct"
    - "--trust-remote-code"
    - "--max-model-len=65536"
```

Modelplane handles fleet scheduling, multi-cluster routing, and infrastructure
composition. Each `ModelDeployment` becomes one or more `ModelReplica`s, each a
complete serving instance on an `InferenceCluster`. A `ModelService` routes
traffic across replicas and (optionally) external SaaS endpoints. The resource
hierarchy mirrors Kubernetes core: ModelDeployment → ModelReplica → ModelService
→ ModelEndpoint parallels Deployment → Pod → Service → Endpoint.

## Background

Open-weight inference is becoming the default for enterprises. Cost control,
governance, and data sovereignty are pushing organizations away from hosted
proprietary models and toward running open-weight models on infrastructure
they control. Kubernetes is the primary substrate. Platform teams are being
asked to provide GPU infrastructure to internal ML teams the same way they
provide cloud infrastructure today.

Within a single cluster, the ecosystem is strong. vLLM and SGLang serve
models. LeaderWorkerSet handles multi-node topologies. DRA binds GPUs to
pods. llm-d adds model-aware routing and prefill/decode coordination. NVIDIA
Dynamo brings KV cache management and GPU-to-GPU weight transfer. Running a
model on a Kubernetes cluster is increasingly a solved problem.

The hard part is the fleet. Organizations have GPU clusters across regions and
clouds, or will soon. Scheduling models to the right hardware, routing inference
traffic across clusters, managing fleet-wide capacity, and providing
self-service to ML teams with organizational governance are all problems that
sit above any single cluster. Nobody ships this layer today.

Platform teams at companies like Apple and JPMC already use Crossplane to manage
cloud infrastructure: unifying AWS, GCP, and Azure behind declarative APIs on a
central control plane. Inference infrastructure is the same pattern. Modelplane
is a fleet-level inference platform built on Crossplane. It solves the same
problems as KServe and Dynamo (scheduling models to hardware, routing traffic,
managing lifecycle and scaling) but across a fleet of clusters rather than
within one.

This document proposes Modelplane's v0.1 API: seven resources that give
platform teams a fleet management layer and ML teams a self-service
deployment interface, with scheduling, routing, and composition handled by
Crossplane composition functions.

## Goals

v0.1 demonstrates that a fleet-level inference control plane is viable and
compelling.

v0.1 is successful if:

1. **End-to-end demo works.** A platform team can install Modelplane, create an
   InferenceCluster, and an ML team can create a ModelDeployment and get a
   working OpenAI-compatible endpoint serving a credibly complex model at scale
   with concurrency-based autoscaling.

2. **Frontier models work.** The same API can express deployments for Kimi K2
   (1T parameter MoE, ~1TB FP8 weights, 16 GPUs across 2 nodes, TP=8 PP=2) and
   Qwen3-Coder-480B (480B MoE, multi-node, 256K context, tool calling). The API
   is credible for the models enterprises actually want to deploy.

3. **Multi-cluster fleet scheduling works.** A ModelDeployment with `replicas:
   2` creates ModelReplicas on two different InferenceClusters, with a unified
   endpoint routing across both.

4. **The API is credible.** An enterprise platform team can look at the resource
   model and see how it extends to their requirements: heterogeneous GPU fleets,
   multi-cloud, disaggregated serving, SaaS fallback routing.

## Target personas

### Platform team

The platform team already operates Crossplane to manage infrastructure for the
wider engineering organization. They control which GPU clusters exist, what
hardware is available, and what policies govern resource usage. In the
Modelplane model, they create `InferenceCluster` resources describing the GPU
clusters in their fleet, select or author `InferenceClass` resources that bundle
hardware capabilities with cloud-specific provisioning recipes, and set
organizational metadata via Kubernetes labels (tier, region, provider,
compliance posture). They may also build Crossplane Compositions over
`ModelDeployment` to provide simpler interfaces for their ML teams, but
Modelplane doesn't prescribe that boundary. Their primary concern is
operational: can they provide inference capacity without becoming a bottleneck?

### ML / application team

The ML team needs to run inference against open-weight models as part of their
product or research. They create a `ModelDeployment` specifying everything
needed to run the model: engine image, engine args, hardware requirements, and
the compute topology. They create a `ModelService` to get a unified endpoint,
and optionally create manual `ModelEndpoint` resources to route to external SaaS
providers (Together, BaseTen) alongside self-hosted replicas. Modelplane handles
scheduling, composition, and routing. The ML team thinks about what model to
deploy and how it should be configured, not where it runs.

## API design

I propose seven resources. The API group is `modelplane.ai`.

| Resource | Scope | Created by | Purpose |
|----------|-------|------------|---------|
| `InferenceGateway` | Cluster | Platform team | Control plane routing infrastructure |
| `InferenceClass` | Cluster | Platform team (or Modelplane defaults) | Hardware recipe: attributes, capacity + provisioning |
| `InferenceCluster` | Cluster | Platform team | A GPU cluster in the inference fleet |
| `ModelDeployment` | Namespace | ML team | Self-contained model deployment spec |
| `ModelReplica` | Namespace | Modelplane (composed) | One complete serving instance |
| `ModelService` | Namespace | ML team | Weighted routing across endpoints |
| `ModelEndpoint` | Namespace | Modelplane (composed) or ML team | Reachable inference endpoint |

The resource hierarchy mirrors Kubernetes core:

| Modelplane | Kubernetes |
|---|---|
| `ModelDeployment` | `Deployment` |
| `ModelReplica` | `Pod` |
| `ModelService` | `Service` |
| `ModelEndpoint` | `Endpoint` |

### InferenceClass

A tested recipe for a GPU node pool. Each class bundles **attributes and
capacity** (what this hardware has, used by the scheduler) and optionally
**provisioning** (how to create it on a specific cloud).

Attributes and capacity follow DRA's schema ([KEP-4381][]). Attributes are typed
qualitative facts the scheduler matches on: architecture, feature flags,
topology kind. Capacity is the quantitative side — a map of Kubernetes
Quantities. Keys use DRA's vendor-namespaced convention: `gpu.nvidia.com/*` for
what the NVIDIA DRA driver publishes, `modelplane.ai/*` for what Modelplane
defines.

[KEP-4381]: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/4381-dra-structured-parameters
[KEP-5075]: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-scheduling/5075-dra-consumable-capacity

Provisioning is optional. Classes without it are for BYO clusters where the
pool already exists. The `provisioning.provider` discriminator selects the
cloud-specific sibling block (gke, eks, aks).

```yaml
apiVersion: modelplane.ai/v1alpha1
kind: InferenceClass
metadata:
  name: gke-h200-8x-a3-ib
spec:
  description: "GKE a3-ultragpu-8g, 8x H200, GPUDirect-TCPX"
  provisioning:
    provider: GKE
    gke:
      machineType: a3-ultragpu-8g
      accelerator:
        type: nvidia-h200-141gb
        count: 8
      diskSizeGb: 200
      networking:
        gpuDirectTCPX: true
  attributes:
    gpu.nvidia.com/architecture:
      string: Hopper
    gpu.nvidia.com/productName:
      string: "NVIDIA H200 141GB HBM3e"
    gpu.nvidia.com/cudaComputeCapability:
      version: "9.0.0"
    gpu.nvidia.com/gpuCount:
      int: 8
    gpu.nvidia.com/features:
      strings: [fp8, bf16, transformer-engine, mig]
    modelplane.ai/interconnectIntraNode:
      string: nvswitch
    modelplane.ai/networkInterNode:
      string: gpudirect-tcpx
  capacity:
    gpu.nvidia.com/memory:
      value: "141Gi"
    modelplane.ai/networkBandwidth:
      value: "200Gi"           # bits per second
```

Different clouds and different networking imply different classes. A GKE H200
pool with GPUDirect-TCPX is `gke-h200-8x-a3-ib`. A Coreweave H200 pool with
InfiniBand is `h200-8x-ib` (no provisioning). The class captures the
complete hardware context, including inter-node networking, because networking
is a property of the pool's hardware, not of the cluster as a whole.

### InferenceCluster

A GPU cluster in the inference fleet. Cluster-level metadata is captured in
standard Kubernetes labels, which are the matching surface for
`ModelDeployment.clusterSelector`. Each pool references an `InferenceClass` for
its hardware capabilities and (for provisioned clusters) provisioning recipe.

```yaml
apiVersion: modelplane.ai/v1alpha1
kind: InferenceCluster
metadata:
  name: prod-gke-us-east
  labels:
    modelplane.ai/tier: production
    cloud.provider: gcp
    cloud.region: us-east1
spec:
  cluster:
    source: GKE
    gke:
      project: acme-ml-platform
      region: us-east1
      kubernetesVersion: "1.35"
  nodePools:
  - name: frontier
    class: gke-h200-8x-a3-ib
    maxNodeCount: 4
    minNodeCount: 0
    nodeCount: 0

  - name: dev
    class: gke-l4-1x-g2
    maxNodeCount: 4
    nodeCount: 1
```

For provisioned clusters (source: GKE), the composition function reads
`InferenceCluster.cluster.gke` for the project and region, and each pool's
`InferenceClass.provisioning.gke` for the machine type and GPU config. It
combines them to provision the GKE node pool. System pools (non-GPU, for
running the inference stack) are provisioned automatically.

For BYO clusters (source: Existing), a kubeconfig Secret provides access.
Modelplane installs the inference stack on the cluster but doesn't provision
infrastructure. The class provides capabilities for scheduling only.

```yaml
apiVersion: modelplane.ai/v1alpha1
kind: InferenceCluster
metadata:
  name: prod-coreweave-us-east
  labels:
    modelplane.ai/tier: production
    cloud.provider: coreweave
    cloud.region: us-east-1
spec:
  cluster:
    source: Existing
    existing:
      secretRef:
        name: coreweave-kubeconfig
        key: kubeconfig
  nodePools:
  - name: frontier
    class: h200-8x-ib
    maxNodeCount: 4
```

Modelplane assumes exclusive ownership of every InferenceCluster. GPU capacity
on the cluster is managed solely by Modelplane; the fleet scheduler's capacity
accounting (maxNodeCount minus nodes consumed by existing ModelReplicas) relies
on this. Modelplane has opinions about how clusters are set up: Kubernetes
version, installed components, cluster configuration, and required features
like DRA. For provisioned clusters Modelplane handles all of this directly. For
BYO clusters the platform team is responsible for meeting these requirements.

Modelplane also installs a software stack onto every InferenceCluster it
manages, including BYO clusters. This stack provides the cluster-level
primitives Modelplane composes onto: support for multi-node serving workloads
(for example LeaderWorkerSet), GPU binding via DRA, and whatever else
Modelplane's composition functions depend on. The contract is that Modelplane
controls what runs on the cluster.

### ModelDeployment

A self-contained model deployment spec. The ML team creates one to deploy a
model to the fleet. Modelplane creates a `ModelReplica` for each replica and
schedules it to an `InferenceCluster`. `ModelDeployment` carries everything
about what to deploy and how: the engine image and args, hardware requirements
via CEL, the compute topology, and the replica count.

```yaml
apiVersion: modelplane.ai/v1alpha1
kind: ModelDeployment
metadata:
  name: mixtral-8x7b
  namespace: ml-team
spec:
  clusterSelector:
    matchLabels:
      modelplane.ai/tier: production
  replicas: 2
  nodeSelector:
    cel: |
      capacity["gpu.nvidia.com/memory"].compareTo(quantity("80Gi")) >= 0
  workers:
    topology:
      strategy: Tensor
      tensor: 2
  engine:
    name: vLLM
    image: vllm/vllm-openai:v0.8.5
    args:
    - "--model=mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1"
    - "--tensor-parallel-size=2"
    - "--max-model-len=32768"
    - "--gpu-memory-utilization=0.9"
```

#### Two-level matching

Cluster-level matching uses `clusterSelector.matchLabels` against standard
Kubernetes labels on InferenceCluster. This is organizational metadata: tier,
region, provider, compliance posture. String equality is sufficient.

Node-level matching uses `nodeSelector.cel`, a CEL expression evaluated against
the pool's `InferenceClass` attributes and capacity. The attribute schema
follows DRA's typed format (`{string: "Hopper"}`, `{int: 8}`, `{version:
"9.0.0"}`) with vendor-namespaced keys (`gpu.nvidia.com/*`, `modelplane.ai/*`).
Capacity uses Kubernetes Quantity values. This alignment means InferenceClass
declarations are schema-validatable at admission time and directly translatable
to DRA ResourceClaim selectors.

#### Workers and topology

`workers` groups the worker count and compute topology. `workers.topology`
describes the shape of one worker; `workers.count` (default 1) says how many
workers of that shape exist per ModelReplica.

`topology.strategy` is a required discriminator:

| Strategy | Required fields | Nodes per worker | GPUs per node | Total GPUs per worker |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Tensor` | `tensor` | 1 | `tensor` | `tensor` |
| `TensorPipeline` | `tensor`, `pipeline` | `pipeline` | `tensor` | `tensor * pipeline` |
| `DataExpert` | `tensor`, `data`, `dataLocal` | `data / dataLocal` | `dataLocal * tensor` | `data * tensor` |

The scheduler derives the physical shape from the topology. No separate node
count or GPU count fields; the topology fully determines the resource
requirements. The scheduler checks: does the matched pool's InferenceClass have
`gpu.nvidia.com/gpucount` >= GPUs-per-node, and does the pool have enough
available nodes?

#### Disaggregated prefill/decode

The top-level `nodeSelector`, `workers`, and `engine` are always the decode (or
unified) settings. Adding a `prefill` block makes the deployment disaggregated.
The `prefill` block is self-contained: it repeats all settings rather than
inheriting from the root, because explicit repetition is easier to reason about
than implicit merge.

The P:D ratio is expressed via `workers.count` on each role. It's a topology
parameter (fixed per deployment), not a scaling knob. Decode and prefill must
land on the same InferenceCluster (KV cache transfer needs co-location) but can
target different pools within that cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: modelplane.ai/v1alpha1
kind: ModelDeployment
metadata:
  name: llama-405b-disagg
  namespace: ml-team
spec:
  clusterSelector:
    matchLabels:
      modelplane.ai/tier: production
  replicas: 1

  # Top-level = decode. 3 decode workers, each TP=8 PP=2.
  nodeSelector:
    cel: |
      capacity["gpu.nvidia.com/memory"].compareTo(quantity("141Gi")) >= 0 &&
      attributes["modelplane.ai/networkInterNode"].string == "infiniband"
  workers:
    count: 3
    topology:
      strategy: TensorPipeline
      tensor: 8
      pipeline: 2
  engine:
    name: vLLM
    image: vllm/vllm-openai:v0.9.1
    args:
    - "--model=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct"
    - "--max-model-len=131072"
    - '--kv-transfer-config={"kv_role":"kv_consumer"}'

  # Prefill: 5 workers, each single-GPU. Self-contained.
  prefill:
    nodeSelector:
      cel: |
        capacity["gpu.nvidia.com/memory"].compareTo(quantity("80Gi")) >= 0 &&
        attributes["modelplane.ai/networkInterNode"].string == "infiniband"
    workers:
      count: 5
      topology:
        strategy: Tensor
        tensor: 1
    engine:
      name: vLLM
      image: vllm/vllm-openai:v0.9.1
      args:
      - "--model=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct"
      - '--kv-transfer-config={"kv_role":"kv_producer"}'
```

### ModelReplica

Composed by `ModelDeployment`, one per `spec.replicas`. A `ModelReplica` is
schematically identical to a `ModelDeployment`, but without `spec.replicas`.

Each replica is one complete serving instance on a chosen InferenceCluster,
containing all the pods needed for that instance: one pod for single-node,
multiple pods via LeaderWorkerSet for multi-node, and both decode and prefill
workloads for disaggregated serving.

The fleet scheduler picks `(InferenceCluster, pool)` per replica independently.
Replicas of the same deployment can land on different clusters or the same
cluster depending on capacity and (in future) anti-affinity policy.

The `ModelReplica` is the intermediate representation (IR) between the
user-facing ModelDeployment and the cluster-level serving workload. The
composition function maps the ModelReplica's topology to the appropriate
cluster-level resource.

### ModelService

A weighted routing surface across `ModelEndpoint`s. Always uses
`spec.endpoints`: a single-entry list for the simple case, multiple entries with
weights for canary, A/B, or SaaS overflow routing. Each entry selects
`ModelEndpoint` resources by label.

Simple — one deployment's replicas behind one endpoint:

```yaml
apiVersion: modelplane.ai/v1alpha1
kind: ModelService
metadata:
  name: kimi-k2
  namespace: ml-team
spec:
  endpoints:
  - selector:
      matchLabels:
        modelplane.ai/deployment: kimi-k2
```

Weighted — canary across two models plus SaaS fallback:

```yaml
apiVersion: modelplane.ai/v1alpha1
kind: ModelService
metadata:
  name: assistant
  namespace: ml-team
spec:
  endpoints:
  # 95% to all replicas of kimi-k2 (round-robin across them).
  - weight: 95
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        modelplane.ai/deployment: kimi-k2
  # 5% to a manually-created external endpoint.
  - weight: 5
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        modelplane.ai/endpoint: together-kimi-k2
```

A route with no `weight` defaults to weight 1 (equal weighting). Composed
endpoints carry the `modelplane.ai/deployment` label set by the deployment
composition; manual endpoints carry whatever labels the deployer puts on them.

### ModelEndpoint

A reachable inference endpoint. Composed by `ModelDeployment` (one per
`ModelReplica`) or created manually for break-glass routing to external
services. Both shapes use the same schema. `ModelService` doesn't care where
they came from.

```yaml
# Composed (one per replica)
apiVersion: modelplane.ai/v1alpha1
kind: ModelEndpoint
metadata:
  name: kimi-k2-coreweave-us-east-0
  namespace: ml-team
  labels:
    modelplane.ai/deployment: kimi-k2
spec:
  url: http://10.0.1.50/ml-team/kimi-k2/
  api: OpenAI

---
# Manual (external SaaS)
apiVersion: modelplane.ai/v1alpha1
kind: ModelEndpoint
metadata:
  name: together-kimi-k2
  namespace: ml-team
  labels:
    modelplane.ai/endpoint: together-kimi-k2
spec:
  url: https://api.together.xyz/v1
  api: OpenAI
  auth:
    secretRef:
      name: together-api-key
```

### InferenceGateway

Configures the control plane's routing infrastructure, the gateway that sits
between ML teams and inference clusters. Cluster-scoped and singleton in
practice (one gateway per control plane). v0.1 uses Envoy Gateway.

```yaml
apiVersion: modelplane.ai/v1alpha1
kind: InferenceGateway
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  envoyGateway:
    version: v1.3.0
  gateway:
    port: 80
status:
  address: 34.56.129.3
```

The ModelService composition function configures routing rules on the gateway.
The status contract is minimal: just `status.address`. Gateway implementation
details (Gateway API resources, Envoy configuration) are composed under the
hood.

## Composition architecture

Each resource has a corresponding Composition powered by a composition function.
The functions use Crossplane v2's required resources mechanism to read across XR
boundaries.

```mermaid

    subgraph platform["Platform team creates"]

```

When an ML team creates a ModelDeployment:

1. The deploy function runs the fleet scheduler (described below) to pick
   `(cluster, pool)` for each replica.
2. It composes a ModelReplica targeting that cluster and a ModelEndpoint for
   routing.
3. The replica function reads engine and topology config from the
   ModelReplica and composes the serving workload on the target cluster.
4. The service function reads the InferenceGateway and matched ModelEndpoints,
   and composes routing resources on the control plane.

## Fleet scheduling

The fleet scheduler picks `(InferenceCluster, pool)` for each ModelReplica:

1. **Filter clusters** by `clusterSelector.matchLabels` against InferenceCluster
   labels.
2. **Filter pools** by evaluating `nodeSelector.cel` against each pool's
   InferenceClass attributes and capacity.
3. **Derive physical shape** from `workers.topology`: nodes per worker, GPUs per
   node.
4. **Check capacity.** Does the pool have enough available nodes? Available =
   `maxNodeCount` minus nodes consumed by existing ModelReplicas on that
   cluster.

Modelplane will support affinity and anti-affinity in a future version.

DRA is the device binding mechanism on every InferenceCluster. The composition
function emits `ResourceClaim`s derived from the matched pool's InferenceClass
attributes and capacity. Because the InferenceClass uses the same DRA schema
and vendor-namespaced keys, the translation is direct. DRA handles actual
device-to-node binding at pod admission time.

## Autoscaling

Replicas are the only scaling axis. Each ModelReplica is a complete,
fixed-topology serving instance. Scaling `spec.replicas` adds or removes whole
instances. There's no in-cluster pod autoscaling, no KEDA or similar on workload
clusters.

The ModelDeployment XRD declares a Kubernetes scale subresource
(`specReplicasPath: .spec.replicas`, `statusReplicasPath: .status.replicas`).
Autoscaling is opt-in via a separate KEDA `ScaledObject`, the same pattern as
Kubernetes Deployment + HPA. KEDA watches aggregate gateway metrics (concurrency
across all replicas) and writes `spec.replicas`. The relavant composition
function reconciles ModelReplicas to match.

## Alternatives considered

### Model catalog (ClusterModel / Model)

I considered splitting model identity and deployment configuration across
separate resources: `ClusterModel` (platform-curated catalog) and
`ModelDeployment` (thin reference). The appeal was separation of concerns:
the platform team maintains tested model configurations, the ML team deploys
from the catalog without understanding engine details.

I dropped this split because the abstraction boundary doesn't hold in
practice. Different quantization variants reference different model weight
checkpoints (FP8 and BF16 are different HuggingFace repos). They're
genuinely different deployments, not different configurations of the same
model. Engine args are inherently model-specific and evolve with every engine
release. And the "platform team maintains the catalog" responsibility is real
ongoing engineering work that most organizations don't have a team for.

With a self-contained ModelDeployment, organizations that want a curated
catalog build a Crossplane Composition over ModelDeployment, the standard
Crossplane pattern for providing simplified interfaces. Modelplane doesn't
prescribe where the abstraction boundary falls.

### Serving profiles

I considered priority-ordered serving profiles on ModelDeployment: "prefer
FP8 on H200, fall back to BF16 on H100." The appeal was scheduling-level
fallback: the scheduler tries profiles in order, only one gets scheduled, no
wasted GPUs.

I dropped profiles because different quantization variants need different
model weight checkpoints (different HuggingFace repos). Profiles would need
nearly-complete deployment specs to accommodate this, at which point they're
just separate ModelDeployments wearing a different syntax. The fallback also
introduces unsolved scheduling questions: when the preferred hardware becomes
available, do you migrate from the fallback? Silent degradation (falling back
to a config with lower context length or different output quality) is
arguably worse than explicit failure.

Without profiles, the deployer makes explicit decisions. Different hardware
targets are separate ModelDeployments. A ModelService routes across them. If
preferential scheduling is needed later, it would be a coordination
mechanism between deployments, not inline profiles.

### Per-placement pod autoscaling

I initially had KEDA on each workload cluster, autoscaling pod replicas
within each placement's LLMInferenceService. Scaling happened at two levels:
fleet (how many clusters) and in-cluster (how many pods per cluster).

I simplified to one scaling axis: whole replicas. Each ModelReplica is a
fixed-topology serving instance. Scaling adds or removes complete instances.
This eliminates KEDA on every workload cluster, per-cluster Prometheus
scraping, and the conceptual complexity of two scaling axes.

KServe's own scaling model validates this approach: LWS groups are scaled as
whole units, never resized. The scaling granularity is the same.

### Source and HuggingFace on ModelDeployment

I initially had `source: HuggingFace` and a `huggingFace` block on
ModelDeployment. Model fetching was Modelplane's concern. It set `model.uri: hf://...` on the
KServe LLMInferenceService, which triggered
KServe's storage initializer.

I dropped this because model fetching is the engine's concern, not
Modelplane's. All major engines (vLLM, SGLang, TGI) accept `--model=<repo>`
and handle downloading natively. KServe's storage initializer is
KServe-specific; neither llm-d nor Dynamo uses it. Having both `source: HF`
and `--model=<repo>` in engine args forced the deployer to keep two fields in
sync.

For fleet-level weight staging (pre-caching weights to nodes), a future
`ModelCache` resource (#66) provides the right abstraction, scoped to the
fleet rather than individual deployments.

### Multiple inference orchestrators

I considered exposing the cluster-level orchestrator (KServe, Dynamo, etc.) as
a user-selectable field, with model configurations carrying a discriminator to
match against compatible clusters.

This creates a lowest-common-denominator problem: if ModelDeployment can
target any orchestrator, it can only express features every orchestrator
supports. Instead, I'd prefer Modelplane to be opinionated about which
orchestrator to use, dispatching based on topology and engine requirements.
The `ModelReplica` is the IR between Modelplane's fleet-level scheduling and
the cluster-level orchestrator. Users describe what they want; Modelplane
picks the lightest composition path that satisfies it.
