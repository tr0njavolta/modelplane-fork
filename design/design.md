# Modelplane v0.1 — Design Document

**Status:** Draft  
**Date:** March 2026  
**Author:** Nic Cope

## Executive summary

Modelplane is an open-source, Crossplane-based inference platform from Upbound.
It gives platform teams a declarative API for inference infrastructure and gives
ML teams a self-service interface to deploy models. The resource model is built
for a world where inference backends are heterogeneous: KServe on a GKE cluster
today, NVIDIA Dynamo on CoreWeave tomorrow. An ML team deploys a model like
this:

```yaml
apiVersion: modelplane.ai/v1alpha1
kind: ModelDeployment
metadata:
  name: llama
  namespace: ml-team
spec:
  modelRef:
    kind: ClusterModel
    name: llama-8b
  environments: 1
```

The platform team pre-configures the inference environment and model catalog
that make this possible. Under the hood, each ModelDeployment composes
`ModelPlacements` (one per target environment) that handle the backend-specific
work of actually running the model. The ML team gets a unified OpenAI-compatible
endpoint; Modelplane handles per-environment composition, status aggregation,
and routing.

## Background

Open-weight inference is going to be the default for enterprises. Cost control,
governance, and data secrecy will push them away from hosted proprietary models
and toward running open-weight models on infrastructure they control. Kubernetes
is the primary substrate, with KServe, vLLM, and the broader ecosystem maturing
fast. But it won't be the only way enterprises run inference. GPU clouds like
CoreWeave and Lambda Labs, managed inference services like BaseTen and NVIDIA
NIM, and hyperscaler AI endpoints are all part of the picture.

Projects like KServe, KubeAI, OME, llm-d, and NVIDIA Dynamo are getting good at
running models on Kubernetes, but they're not platforms in the same way
Kubernetes isn't a platform. They're scoped to one cluster, they expose
infrastructure concepts to their consumers, and they have no opinions about
teams or organizational policy. A platform team that adopts KServe still has to
build the multi-cluster topology, the self-service abstraction layer, and the
governance model on top of it.

Platform teams at companies like Apple and JPMC already use Crossplane to do
this kind of work for cloud infrastructure: unifying AWS, GCP, and Azure behind
declarative APIs on a central control plane. These teams are now being asked to
provide inference infrastructure to internal ML teams. KServe and its peers are
to Modelplane what cloud provider APIs are to Crossplane: powerful backends that
need a platform layer above them to become self-service with guardrails.
Modelplane is an opinionated platform layer, built on Crossplane v2.

## Goals

v0.1 is a proof-of-concept. Its job is to demonstrate that a Crossplane-native
inference platform is viable and compelling — not to be production-complete.

v0.1 is successful if:

1. **End-to-end demo works:** A platform team can install Modelplane, create an
   InferenceEnvironment, register a model, and an ML team can create a
   ModelDeployment and get a working OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

2. **Multi-environment demo works:** A ModelDeployment targeting multiple
   InferenceEnvironments creates ModelPlacements on each. A unified endpoint
   routes requests across placements.

3. **The abstraction layer is credible:** The XR APIs are clean enough that an
   enterprise platform team can look at them and see how they'd extend to their
   requirements. The resource model makes intuitive sense.

4. **Modelplane feels like a real project:** Someone discovering Modelplane
   should see an open-source inference platform, not "just a Crossplane
   Configuration." That means its own identity (name, repo, docs, examples), a
   getting-started experience that doesn't require deep Crossplane knowledge,
   and enough polish that it's worth showing to people outside Upbound.

It's explicitly **not** a goal for v0.1 to:

- Support advanced policy (cost-based routing, advanced scheduling)
- Support non-LLM workloads (embeddings, speech-to-text, image generation)
- Support multiple cloud providers (GKE is the sole provider)
- Include LoRA adapter management

## Target personas

### Platform team (provider)

The platform team already operates Crossplane to manage infrastructure for the
wider engineering organization. They control which Kubernetes clusters exist,
what GPU hardware is available, and what policies govern resource usage. In the
Modelplane model, they:

- Install and configure Modelplane on their Crossplane control plane
- Define `InferenceEnvironment` resources that describe available inference
  targets and their capabilities
- Optionally curate a catalog of `ClusterModel` resources for approved
  open-weight models
- Set organizational defaults for engine configuration, resource limits, and
  security policies
- Monitor inference workloads across clusters

Their primary concern is operational: can they provide inference capacity
without becoming a bottleneck, while maintaining the guardrails their
organization requires?

### ML / application team (consumer)

The consumer team needs to run inference against open-weight models as part of
their product or research. They don't want to learn Kubernetes, Helm, KServe, or
Coreweave. In the Modelplane model, they:

- Create a `ModelDeployment` resource in their namespace specifying what model
  they want and optionally which environments to target
- Receive a unified OpenAI-compatible endpoint that routes across all target
  environments
- Optionally bring their own fine-tuned model weights via a `Model` resource
- Inspect per-environment `ModelPlacement` resources to debug issues on specific
  clusters

Their primary concern is velocity: how quickly can they go from "I need Llama 3
70B running" to "here's my endpoint"?

## Proposal

### API design

Modelplane defines six Crossplane composite resources (XRs). The API group is
`modelplane.ai`.

| CRD | Scope | Created by | Purpose |
|-----|-------|------------|---------|
| `InferenceGateway` | Cluster | Platform team | Control plane routing infrastructure |
| `InferenceEnvironment` | Cluster | Platform team | Inference environment with backend |
| `ClusterModel` | Cluster | Platform team | Model catalog |
| `Model` | Namespace | ML team | Private fine-tuned models |
| `ModelDeployment` | Namespace | ML team | Multi-environment deployment |
| `ModelPlacement` | Namespace | Typically composed by ModelDeployment | Per-environment deployment and routing |

`InferenceGateway`, `ClusterModel`, and `InferenceEnvironment` are
cluster-scoped (platform infrastructure). `Model`, `ModelDeployment`, and
`ModelPlacement` are namespace-scoped (team resources). This eliminates
cross-namespace references. Namespaced resources reference cluster-scoped
resources or resources in their own namespace.

### ClusterModel and Model

`ClusterModel` (cluster-scoped) and `Model` (namespace-scoped) share the same
schema. `ClusterModel` is for the platform team's curated catalog: approved
open-weight models available organization-wide. `Model` is for ML teams to
register their own fine-tuned models privately within their namespace.

#### ClusterModel (`clustermodels.modelplane.ai/v1alpha1`)

```yaml
apiVersion: modelplane.ai/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterModel
metadata:
  name: llama-3.1-70b-instruct       # No namespace — cluster-scoped
  labels:
    modelplane.ai/family: llama
    modelplane.ai/size: 70b
spec:
  # Model identity
  model:
    name: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct    # Model name passed to the serving engine

  # Where to download the model from (source and its config object are paired)
  source: HuggingFace                # HuggingFace | S3 | GCS | PVC
  huggingFace:
    repo: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct
    revision: main                   # Git revision (branch, tag, commit)
    secretRef:                       # Optional: for gated models
      namespace: platform-system
      name: hf-token

  # Hardware requirements — total VRAM the model needs. The scheduler divides
  # this by per-GPU VRAM of each candidate environment to compute GPU count.
  resources:
    vram: "140Gi"

  # Serving profiles — how this model is served on each backend. Each profile
  # is a complete, tested configuration for a specific (backend, engine) pair.
  # Array order is priority: the first profile that matches wins.
  serving:
  - name: vllm-kserve
    backend: KServe                  # Required discriminator — matches IE backend
    engine:                          # Required for K8s backends (KServe, Dynamo)
      name: vLLM
      image: vllm/vllm-openai:v0.8.0
      args:                          # Opaque — passed through to the engine
      - "--max-model-len=32768"
      - "--gpu-memory-utilization=0.9"

status:
  conditions:
    - type: Ready                    # Summary condition: model is registered
      status: "True"
      reason: Available
      lastTransitionTime: "2026-03-03T10:00:00Z"
      observedGeneration: 1
```

Each serving profile binds a model to a specific backend and engine. The
`backend` field is a required discriminator that determines what other fields
are valid. For Kubernetes backends (KServe, Dynamo), the `engine` block is
required. Future SaaS backends (e.g., Together AI) may not expose engine
configuration at all — `backend` gates this.

The `engine` block carries the container image, the engine name (which tells
the placement function engine-specific mechanics like Dynamo's
`backendFramework` and module paths), and opaque CLI args. Modelplane does not
interpret engine args — they're passed through to the container. Engine flags
evolve with every engine release; treating them as opaque avoids a perpetual
schema maintenance burden. The only things Modelplane derives from the model
are the model name/URI on the container and the GPU count from VRAM.

An organization running both KServe and Dynamo (e.g., during a backend
migration) adds a second profile:

```yaml
  serving:
  - name: vllm-kserve
    backend: KServe
    engine:
      name: vLLM
      image: vllm/vllm-openai:v0.8.0
      args: ["--max-model-len=32768", "--gpu-memory-utilization=0.9"]
  - name: vllm-dynamo
    backend: Dynamo
    engine:
      name: vLLM
      image: nvcr.io/nvidia/ai-dynamo/vllm-runtime:1.0.1
      args: ["--max-model-len=32768"]
```

Most organizations standardize on one backend and one engine, so most
ClusterModels have a single serving profile. Profile proliferation is bounded
by the number of backends in use — typically one or two.

Profiles can also carry an optional `environmentSelector` for capability-based
matching. A profile that uses FP8 quantization (requiring Hopper GPUs) can
require environments with a specific label, separate from the backend match:

```yaml
  - name: vllm-kserve-fp8
    backend: KServe
    environmentSelector:
      matchLabels:
        modelplane.ai/gpu-arch: hopper
    engine:
      name: vLLM
      image: vllm/vllm-openai:v0.8.0
      args: ["--quantization=fp8", "--max-model-len=32768"]
```

The ML team picks from the catalog without needing to understand engine
profiles. The ClusterModel name no longer encodes the engine — it's just the
model. Advanced ML teams that want to tune engine flags can create a namespaced
`Model` with their own serving profiles.


### InferenceGateway (`inferencegateways.modelplane.ai/v1alpha1`)

An `InferenceGateway` configures the control plane's routing infrastructure —
the gateway that sits between ML teams and inference environments. It's
cluster-scoped and singleton in practice (one gateway per control plane). It
parallels `InferenceEnvironment`: one is "where models run", the other is "how
you reach them."

The `backend` discriminator selects the gateway implementation. v0.1 supports
Envoy Gateway; future versions could add LiteLLM for intelligent routing
(cost-aware, performance-aware, model-name-aware). The nested `loadBalancer`
discriminator handles how the gateway gets an external address — MetalLB for
kind and bare-metal clusters, omitted for cloud environments where a native LB
controller is available.

```yaml
apiVersion: modelplane.ai/v1alpha1
kind: InferenceGateway
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  backend: EnvoyGateway                  # EnvoyGateway | (LiteLLM in v0.2)
  envoyGateway:
    version: v1.3.0
    loadBalancer: MetalLB                # Optional — for kind/bare-metal
    metallb:
      addressPool: "172.18.255.200-172.18.255.250"
  gateway:
    port: 80

status:
  address: 34.56.129.3                   # External address of the gateway
```

The status contract is deliberately minimal: just `status.address`. No
gateway-specific fields like Gateway API names or namespaces — those are
implementation details of the Envoy Gateway backend. A LiteLLM backend would
surface the same `status.address` without any Gateway API concepts leaking
through.

ModelPlacements read the InferenceGateway to configure routing for their
environment. They compose backend-specific routing resources (e.g., Gateway API
HTTPRoutes for Envoy Gateway, or config entries for LiteLLM) so that the
gateway routes traffic to the remote cluster where the model runs.

### InferenceEnvironment (`inferenceenvironments.modelplane.ai/v1alpha1`)

An `InferenceEnvironment` represents a target where inference workloads can run.
It is cluster-scoped — InferenceEnvironments are infrastructure managed by
platform teams, not owned by any single namespace.

The `backend` discriminator is the top-level intent: "I want an inference
environment running KServe" (or Dynamo, or a managed inference API). Everything
else — including the cluster the backend runs on — is a property of the
backend's configuration. A KServe backend needs a Kubernetes cluster, so
`spec.kserve.cluster` carries a second discriminated union for cluster
provisioning (`source: GKE` paired with `gke: {...}`, or `source: Existing`
for bring-your-own). A hosted backend wouldn't have a `cluster` block at all
— just credentials and region config.

v0.1 assumes dedicated inference environments. The environment exists solely for
Modelplane workloads, with no shared scheduling or noisy-neighbor concerns. This
simplifies RBAC, resource accounting, and composition significantly.

The cloud-specific config is designed for progressive disclosure. The only
required GKE fields are `project` and `region` — if `nodePools` is omitted,
Modelplane provisions a default system pool (e2-standard-4, 2 nodes) and a
single GPU pool (g2-standard-4, 1x nvidia-l4). The resolved configuration — spec
with defaults filled in — is written to `status.resolved`.

```yaml
apiVersion: modelplane.ai/v1alpha1
kind: InferenceEnvironment
metadata:
  name: gpu-us-east                      # No namespace — cluster-scoped
  labels:

    modelplane.ai/region: us-east
spec:
  backend: KServe                        # KServe | Dynamo | (KubeAI in v0.2)
  kserve:
    version: v0.16.0

    # Cluster provisioning — not every backend needs a cluster. KServe does.
    # The source discriminator selects provisioning or bring-your-own.
    cluster:
      source: GKE                        # GKE | EKS | Existing
      gke:
        project: acme-ml-platform
        region: us-east1
        # nodePools is optional. If omitted, Modelplane provisions a default
        # system pool and a single L4 GPU pool. The resolved config (with
        # defaults filled in) appears in status.resolved.

    nodeGroups:
      - name: gpu
  gateway:
    address: 10.0.1.50
```

Platform teams with existing Kubernetes clusters can bring their own
infrastructure instead of having Modelplane provision it. The `cluster` block
accepts `source: Existing` as an alternative to a cloud provider:

```yaml
apiVersion: modelplane.ai/v1alpha1
kind: InferenceEnvironment
metadata:
  name: gpu-us-east-byo
spec:
  backend: KServe
  kserve:
    version: v0.16.0
    cluster:
      source: Existing
      existing:
        secretRef:
          name: gpu-cluster-kubeconfig
          key: kubeconfig
  modelCache:
    enabled: true
    storageClass: local-nvme
    storageCapacity: 500Gi
```

Modelplane still installs and manages the backend (KServe, gateway, model
caching) on the cluster. It just doesn't provision the cluster itself. This
covers enterprise platform teams that manage clusters via Terraform, Cluster
API, or their own Crossplane Compositions and don't want Modelplane recreating
them.

Labels on InferenceEnvironment serve a dual purpose: informational metadata and
selection targets. ModelDeployments can target environments by label selector
(e.g., `modelplane.ai/tier: production`), which is how multi-environment
deployment works without hard-coded environment references.

### ModelDeployment (`modeldeployments.modelplane.ai/v1alpha1`)

A `ModelDeployment` is the primary consumer-facing API. ML teams create one to
deploy a model across one or more InferenceEnvironments. Modelplane creates a
`ModelPlacement` for each matched environment and aggregates their status.

ModelDeployment is deliberately backend-agnostic. It handles environment
discovery, scheduling, fan-out, and routing aggregation. It composes a
Gateway API HTTPRoute that load-balances across all its placements' backends
— but it doesn't know or care what kind of backend they are. The
backend-specific routing resources (e.g., Envoy Gateway Backends) are
composed by ModelPlacement.

The simplest possible deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: modelplane.ai/v1alpha1
kind: ModelDeployment
metadata:
  name: llama-70b-production
  namespace: ml-team-a
spec:
  # What model to deploy
  modelRef:
    kind: ClusterModel          # ClusterModel | Model
    name: llama-3.1-70b-instruct

  # How many environments to deploy to (required)
  environments: 1

status:
  conditions:
    - type: Ready                    # Summary: at least one placement is serving traffic
      status: "True"
      reason: PlacementsAvailable
  endpoint:
    url: https://llama-70b-production.inference.example.com
  placements:
    total: 1
    ready: 1
  model:
    name: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct
```

Modelplane matches model serving profiles against available environments. For
each candidate environment, Modelplane walks the ClusterModel's `serving[]`
array and selects the first profile whose `backend` matches the environment's
backend and whose `environmentSelector` (if any) matches the environment's
labels. Environments with no matching profile are eliminated. VRAM-based
capacity filtering ensures the model fits on the environment's GPUs.

For power users who need to target specific environments, `environmentSelector`
is an optional escape hatch:

```yaml
apiVersion: modelplane.ai/v1alpha1
kind: ModelDeployment
metadata:
  name: llama-70b-global
  namespace: ml-team-a
spec:
  modelRef:
    kind: ClusterModel
    name: llama-3.1-70b-instruct

  # Deploy to 2 of the matching environments
  environments: 2

  # Optional: target specific environments by label
  environmentSelector:
    matchLabels:
      modelplane.ai/tier: production

status:
  conditions:
    - type: Ready
      status: "True"
      reason: PlacementsAvailable
  endpoint:
    url: https://llama-70b-global.inference.example.com
  placements:
    total: 2
    ready: 2
  model:
    name: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct
```

If a new InferenceEnvironment appears that matches the selector (or model
requirements, when no selector is specified), Modelplane automatically creates a
ModelPlacement for it.

Each ModelDeployment gets a unique endpoint derived from the InferenceGateway
address and the deployment's namespace and name:
`http://<gateway-address>/<namespace>/<deployment-name>/v1/chat/completions`.
The control plane gateway matches the path prefix and rewrites it to the
remote KServe path, load-balancing across all placements' backends. Since every
placement uses the ClusterModel name as the LLMInferenceService name on its
remote cluster, the rewrite target is the same for all backends — fixing
multi-environment routing.

Future versions with model-name-aware routing (e.g., LiteLLM as the
InferenceGateway backend) could simplify this to a single gateway-wide
endpoint where the `model` field in the request body selects the backend.

Individual placement endpoints are available on the ModelPlacement resources
for debugging, but the intended production pattern is to always go through
the unified gateway endpoint.

### ModelPlacement (`modelplacements.modelplane.ai/v1alpha1`)

A `ModelPlacement` is the resource that actually deploys a model and registers
it with the routing layer. When Modelplane creates a ModelPlacement, it
composes the backend-specific resources that run the model on a specific
InferenceEnvironment — for a KServe backend, that means creating an
`LLMInferenceService` on the target cluster; for Dynamo, a
`DynamoGraphDeployment`. It also reads the
InferenceGateway and composes routing resources so the gateway can reach the
model — for an Envoy Gateway backend, that means a Backend and HTTPRoute on
the control plane.

ModelPlacement is the only function that knows about specific backends. It
reads the ClusterModel's matched serving profile to get the engine name,
container image, and args, then composes the appropriate backend-specific
resource. Adding a new backend means updating this one function. An
InferenceEnvironment provisions infrastructure and installs the backend,
but no models are running until a ModelPlacement targets it. A ClusterModel
describes how a model should be served, but it's inert until referenced by a
ModelPlacement.

ModelDeployments create ModelPlacements automatically — one per matched
InferenceEnvironment. ML teams aren't intended to create them directly, but
nothing stops them from doing so.

```yaml
apiVersion: modelplane.ai/v1alpha1
kind: ModelPlacement
metadata:
  name: llama-70b-global-us-east      # Generated by ModelDeployment composition
  namespace: ml-team-a
  labels:
    modelplane.ai/deployment: llama-70b-global
spec:
  # What to deploy
  modelRef:
    kind: ClusterModel
    name: llama-3.1-70b-instruct

  # Where to deploy it
  inferenceEnvironmentRef:
    name: gpu-cluster-us-east

status:
  conditions:
    - type: Ready                    # Model is serving traffic on this environment
      status: "True"
      reason: Available
    - type: ModelCached              # Weights were found in cache at startup
      status: "True"
      reason: CacheAvailable
    - type: EndpointAvailable        # Per-environment endpoint is reachable
      status: "True"
      reason: GatewayRouteConfigured
  servingProfile:                    # Resolved by compose-model-deployment
    name: vllm-kserve
    backend: KServe
    engine:
      name: vLLM
      image: vllm/vllm-openai:v0.8.0
  model:
    name: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct
  endpoint:
    internalURL: http://llama-70b-global.ml-team-a.svc.cluster.local:8000
```

```
$ kubectl get modelplacements -n ml-team-a
NAME                        ENVIRONMENT          READY
llama-70b-global-us-east    gpu-cluster-us-east  True
llama-70b-global-us-west    gpu-cluster-us-west  True
```

ModelPlacement's spec is just `modelRef` and `inferenceEnvironmentRef`. The
deploy function resolves which serving profile to use during placement creation.
The matched profile — including backend, engine name, and image — is written to
`status.servingProfile` as computed output. The placement function reads the
full profile (including opaque args) from the ClusterModel to compose the
backend-specific resources.

### Composition architecture

Each XRD has a corresponding Composition powered by a Python composition
function. 

The following diagram shows how the six public resources relate to each other
and to the internal XRs that Modelplane composes under the hood:

Five composition functions, one per concern:

| Function | Responsibility |
|----------|---------------|
| `function-modelplane-gateway` | Composes the control plane routing infrastructure. Dispatches on gateway backend (Envoy Gateway, LiteLLM). Surfaces `status.address` for ModelPlacements. |
| `function-modelplane-env` | Dispatches on inference backend and cloud provider discriminators. Composes `GKECluster` and `KServeBackend` XRs, wires them together, populates `status.capacity`. Adding a new backend or cloud provider means adding a branch here. |
| `function-modelplane-model` | Validates model catalog entries for both `ClusterModel` and `Model`. Registration and validation only — caching is an environment concern. |
| `function-modelplane-deploy` | Backend-agnostic fan-out and routing aggregation. Resolves target environments, matches serving profiles to environments (by backend and optional label selector), stamps placements, composes a Gateway API HTTPRoute that load-balances across all placements' backends, aggregates status. |
| `function-modelplane-placement` | The only function that knows about specific backends. Reads the referenced Model (including its matched serving profile), InferenceEnvironment, and InferenceGateway. Uses the profile's engine name, image, and args to compose backend-specific model serving resources (LLMInferenceService for KServe, DynamoGraphDeployment for Dynamo) and routing endpoint resources (Envoy Gateway Backend). Adding a new inference or routing backend means updating this one function. |

The `GKECluster` and `KServeBackend` XRs are internal implementation details —
they have their own XRDs and composition functions but are not part of
Modelplane's public API. They provide clean boundaries: the env function
delegates to specialist XRs and wires them together.

The composition functions rely on Crossplane v2's **required resources**
mechanism to read across XR boundaries. `function-modelplane-deploy` requests
InferenceEnvironments for fan-out. `function-modelplane-placement` requests the
referenced Model, InferenceEnvironment, and InferenceGateway for backend
composition and routing.

## Alternatives considered

### Separate engine configuration CRs

I considered separate Engine CRs that would decouple engine configuration from
model identity. This has real appeal: the platform team maintains models and
engine profiles as independent catalogs, engine config updates happen in one
place, and the model catalog is purely about model identity.

The problem is that engine args are inherently both model-specific and
engine-specific. `--max-model-len=32768` is a vLLM flag that varies per model.
If an engine profile must contain all engine configuration (no merging from
multiple sources), two different models would almost never share a profile.
If instead the model carries per-engine arg overrides to merge with a shared
profile, the model is engine-aware anyway — and you've reinvented serving
profiles split across two resources.

Additionally, centralized engine version management (upgrade one profile,
all models change) is the wrong operational model. In practice you want to
upgrade engine versions per-model: test with one model, roll out gradually,
keep others pinned. A shared profile upgrades every model simultaneously with
no way to canary.

Serving profiles on ClusterModel preserve the "complete deployable unit"
property while handling multiple backends. Each profile is a tested
combination of (model, backend, engine, image, args). The ML team still sees
one ref — no engine concepts leak to consumers. See
[#18](https://github.com/modelplaneai/modelplane/issues/18) for the full
design rationale.

### Namespace-as-environment

Using Kubernetes namespaces as the environment boundary has appeal (clean RBAC,
GitOps-friendly) but conflates the organizational boundary (teams and stages)
with the infrastructure boundary (GPU clusters). In practice, one GPU cluster
serves multiple teams. Cluster-scoped InferenceEnvironments shared by namespaced
ModelDeployments matches how enterprise platform teams actually manage shared
infrastructure.

### Custom InferenceEnvironment Compositions

I considered letting platform teams provide their own Compositions for
InferenceEnvironment (or for the internal GKECluster and KServeBackend XRs) as
the customization mechanism for bring-your-own infrastructure. This is how
Crossplane customization normally works — the XRD is the contract, the
Composition is swappable.

The problem is that Modelplane's composition functions cross resource
boundaries. The deploy function reads InferenceEnvironments to decide where to
place models. The placement function reads the InferenceEnvironment to figure
out how to deploy a model on its backend. A custom InferenceEnvironment
Composition doesn't help if the platform team wants an unsupported backend —
they'd also need a custom placement function, and potentially a custom deploy
function. That's too much surface area to customize from outside the project.

The bring-your-own-cluster path (`source: Existing` with a kubeconfig Secret)
covers the realistic customization need: the platform team controls cluster
provisioning, Modelplane controls the backend and model deployment.
Adding new backends (Dynamo, KubeAI) is a contribution to Modelplane, not a
per-platform-team customization.

## Future work

Capabilities deferred from v0.1, ordered roughly by how soon I think they'll be
needed.

**Immutable deployments and propagation control.** v0.1 follows Crossplane's
continuous reconciliation. Changes to Model config propagate to running
placements automatically. 

**Intelligent routing.** v0.1 uses Envoy Gateway for basic model-name routing
across environments. Future versions should support cost-aware and
performance-aware routing — selecting backends based on GPU pricing, latency,
throughput, and queue depth. LiteLLM is a natural candidate for the
InferenceGateway backend here: it supports load balancing across
OpenAI-compatible endpoints with cost tracking, rate limiting, and fallbacks.
The InferenceGateway API's `backend` discriminator is designed for this
evolution — adding `backend: LiteLLM` would mean ModelPlacement composes
LiteLLM config entries instead of Gateway API HTTPRoutes. The routing
concern stays in ModelPlacement either way.

**Policy.** Typed policy resources (PlacementPolicy, ResourcePolicy,
RoutingPolicy, ModelPolicy, etc.). These could be namespace-scoped, one per
namespace. . The namespace is the enforcement boundary, following the LimitRange
/ PodSecurity pattern.

**`modelplane` CLI.** `modelplane deploy`, `modelplane status`, `modelplane
logs`. Out of scope for v0.1 where `kubectl` suffices.

**LoRA adapter orchestration.** Dynamic adapter loading, routing, and lifecycle
management.

**Canary deployments.** Progressive rollout with traffic splitting. Depends on
immutable deployments and the Gateway API Inference Extension.

**Cost estimation and observability.** Estimated GPU cost per ModelDeployment,
Prometheus/Grafana dashboards for inference metrics.

## Open questions

**Autoscaling complexity:** KEDA + Prometheus + vLLM custom metrics is a lot of
machinery for the placement function to compose. Should v0.1 ship with simpler
backend-managed scaling (fixed replicas + HPA on a basic metric) and defer KEDA
integration to v0.2?

**InferenceEnvironment lifecycle coupling:** If a platform team deletes an
InferenceEnvironment, what happens to ModelPlacements targeting it?
ModelPlacements are owned by ModelDeployments, not InferenceEnvironments. The
deploy function would need to detect the missing environment and remove the
orphaned placement. The placement function would need to handle the unresolvable
ref with a clear status condition rather than failing silently.

**Inferring model resource requirements:** `ClusterModel` and `Model` currently
require the platform team or ML team to specify `spec.resources` (GPU count,
memory, CPU) and `modelSize` manually. In principle these could be inferred from
the model source — HuggingFace model cards include parameter counts and
safetensors headers include tensor shapes and dtypes, which is enough to
estimate VRAM requirements and disk size. OME does this via automatic parsing of
safetensors headers. The question is whether v0.1 should require explicit
resource specs (simpler, no source-specific logic in the model function) or
infer them when possible and let the spec override.

**Environment capacity and scheduling for BYO clusters:** When Modelplane
provisions a cluster, it knows the GPU capacity from the node pool config. For
bring-your-own clusters, capacity is unknown — and even for provisioned
clusters, node autoscaling means declared capacity may not reflect reality. The
deploy function uses capacity to check whether the model's VRAM requirements
fit on the environment's GPUs. For BYO clusters this information isn't
available. One option is to make capacity purely informational and have the
deploy function only check serving profile compatibility (backend match), letting
the actual scheduling happen at the Kubernetes level when the ModelPlacement
composes backend-specific resources. If the cluster can't schedule the pods, the
placement reports that via status conditions rather than being rejected upfront.
