**The open source control plane for AI models.**

Modelplane extends [Crossplane] to manage AI model inference as declarative
infrastructure. Platform teams provision GPU clusters, configure inference
clusters, and curate a model catalog. ML teams deploy from that catalog and get
back a working endpoint. The control plane handles scheduling, scaling, and
reconciliation continuously.

## Deploy a model

```yaml
apiVersion: modelplane.ai/v1alpha1
kind: ModelDeployment
metadata:
  name: qwen
  namespace: ml-team
spec:
  modelRef:
    name: qwen-2-5-0-5b
  clusters: 2
```

This deploys Qwen 2.5 0.5B to two inference clusters and produces a unified,
OpenAI-compatible endpoint. The platform decides where to place the model based
on GPU capacity.

## How it works

Modelplane draws a clear boundary between two teams.

**Platform teams** create `InferenceClusters`, which are Kubernetes clusters
configured for model serving. They also register approved models as `Models` in
a catalog. Each model specifies its source, VRAM requirements, and one or more
serving profiles that configure vLLM.

**ML teams** create a `ModelDeployment` referencing a catalog model and specify
how many clusters to deploy across. Modelplane matches serving profiles to
available clusters, checks GPU capacity, and creates a `ModelReplica` per
cluster. Traffic routes through a unified [Envoy Gateway] endpoint on the
control plane.

Modelplane is the control plane layer above the inference engine. It doesn't
compete with vLLM or KServe. It manages them.

## Current status

Modelplane is at v0.1. It's early and evolving fast.

| | What works today |
|---|---|
| Cluster sources | GKE (provisioned), Existing (bring your own kubeconfig) |
| Serving engines | vLLM |
| Scaling | Fixed replicas, concurrency-based autoscaling |
| Routing | Unified OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

See [issues labeled `enhancement`][enhancements] for what's planned.

## Getting started

Follow the [getting started guide](docs/getting-started.md) to deploy Modelplane
on a local kind cluster and serve a model on GKE. The
[concepts page](docs/concepts.md) explains the key resources and how they relate.

The [`examples/`](examples/) directory has annotated manifests covering the full
workflow: gateway setup, cluster provisioning, and model deployments.

## Development

Modelplane uses [Nix] for builds and the development environment. You don't need
Nix installed locally. See [CONTRIBUTING.md] for how to get set up, run checks,
and submit changes.

## Get involved
