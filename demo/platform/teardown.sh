# Delete IEs with foreground cascading deletion. This blocks until the IE
# and ALL its composed resources are fully deleted. The Usage resource
# ensures correct deletion order: KServeBackend (Helm releases) deletes
# before GKECluster, so Helm can cleanly uninstall from the still-running
# cluster.
#
# Delete each IE in parallel since they're independent. Each typically
# takes ~10-15 minutes.
