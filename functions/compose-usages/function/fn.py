"""Protect ProviderConfigs from deletion until their consumers are gone.

This function runs late in a composition pipeline. It reads the desired
resources accumulated by earlier functions and, for every Helm Release or
provider-kubernetes Object that references a ProviderConfig, composes a Usage
holding that ProviderConfig until the Release or Object is deleted.

A Usage's `by` selector resolves to a single resource: the Usage controller
lists candidates, takes the first one, and stops. So one Usage protects a
ProviderConfig against exactly one consumer. To protect it against all of them
this function emits one Usage per consumer, pinning each `by` selector to a
single resource with a unique label it stamps on that resource.

The function is generic. Any pipeline whose resources reference a ProviderConfig
gets correct protection by running it as a late step, with no per-composition
configuration. ProviderConfigs that no resource references get no Usage.
