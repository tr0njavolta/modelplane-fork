"""Deploy a model on a single InferenceCluster.

This function reads the referenced InferenceCluster via required resources, then
composes the cluster-level serving resources for each of the replica's worker
engines. An engine's member roles select its backend: a Standalone member composes
to a Deployment (native), a Leader plus Worker to a LeaderWorkerSet (llm-d). One
shared Service and HTTPRoute front all of a replica's engines.

Each member's template is a curated subset of PodTemplateSpec. The container
named "engine" is the inference engine; its image, command, and args are passed
through verbatim to the composed workload - Modelplane injects no engine flags.
