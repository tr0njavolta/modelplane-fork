"""Schedule a ModelDeployment's replicas across inference clusters.

The scheduler is a pure function of observed state. Every reconcile it is
handed the deployment, every InferenceCluster with its published capacity, and
every existing ModelReplica, and it recomputes the whole placement from
scratch. Given the same observed state it returns the same placement, so it is
safe to run on every reconcile.

A replica's identity is the pair (cluster, index): the cluster it runs on and a
per-cluster-local index that distinguishes co-located replicas of the same
deployment. The index is a collision breaker, not an ordering - replicas are
fungible. A replica never moves cluster. If its cluster is deleted (or, in
future, drained) the replica's desired entry stops being emitted, Crossplane
garbage-collects it, and the fill phase mints a fresh replica elsewhere to
refill the deployment's replica count. Moving is always delete-plus-create,
mirroring how Kubernetes treats a Pod whose node is gone.

A replica is a set of engines co-scheduled onto one cluster. The unit of pool
placement is the engine member: each member carries its own nodeSelector, so
each is placed on a pool of that cluster that satisfies it. A gang's members
usually want the same hardware, and they talk over the pool's fabric, so the
scheduler prefers one pool that satisfies every member of an engine; only when
no single pool does are the members split across pools. A member with no
nodeSelector claims no devices - it's pinned to the pool of its engine's first
claiming member at zero node cost, packed onto the gang's nodes by the
cluster's scheduler. The scheduler therefore asks, for each candidate cluster,
whether every member of every engine can be assigned a pool with enough free
nodes, all on that one cluster.

Scheduling runs in two phases:

1. Retain. For each existing replica, keep its (cluster, index) if the cluster
   still exists and every member's pinned pool still satisfies the (possibly
   edited) nodeSelectors. Retention is otherwise unconditional: a healthy
   replica is never moved or dropped to improve the global picture. A degraded
   cluster (not Ready, or no gateway address) is still retained - transient
   outages surface via the deployment's conditions, not re-placement. This is
   what makes the scheduler stable: existing placements are inputs, not
   decisions.

2. Fill. If the deployment wants more replicas than were retained, place the
   shortfall one at a time. Each new replica goes to the eligible cluster
   hosting the fewest of this deployment's replicas (spread first, pack only
   when every eligible cluster already has its share), against a running ledger
   of free node capacity so we never overcommit a cluster. If the deployment
   wants fewer, drop the highest-index replicas first, consolidating off the
   clusters we packed onto last.

Capacity is gated on nodes, not on individual DRA devices. The per-node device
count is a device request's count; the only number the scheduler reads from a
member is its node cost, which it gates against a pool's available nodes. A
member's pods occupy nodes only when they claim devices, so a member that
resolves no claim: DRA device - it carried no nodeSelector, or matched only
synthetic devices - costs zero nodes. Device-count contention BETWEEN
deployments is left to DRA admission on the workload cluster, which is
authoritative: it rejects a Pod whose ResourceClaim can't be satisfied, and the
next reconcile sees the updated observed state. The control-plane scheduler
stays deliberately coarse - "could this cluster plausibly host this replica" -
rather than duplicating the real DRA scheduler.
