"""Schedule a ModelDeployment's replicas across inference clusters.

The scheduler is a pure function of observed state. Every reconcile it is
handed the deployment, every InferenceCluster with its published capacity, and
every existing ModelReplica, and it recomputes the whole placement from
scratch. Given the same observed state it returns the same placement, so it is
safe to run on every reconcile.

A replica's identity is the pair (cluster, index): the cluster it runs on and a
per-cluster-local index that distinguishes co-located replicas of the same
deployment. The index is a collision breaker, not an ordering - replicas are
fungible. A replica never moves cluster. If its cluster is deleted (or, in
future, drained) the replica's desired entry stops being emitted, Crossplane
garbage-collects it, and the fill phase mints a fresh replica elsewhere to
refill the deployment's replica count. Moving is always delete-plus-create,
mirroring how Kubernetes treats a Pod whose node is gone.

Scheduling runs in two phases:

1. Retain. For each existing replica, keep its (cluster, index) if the cluster
   still exists and its pinned pool still satisfies the (possibly edited)
   nodeSelector. Retention is otherwise unconditional: a healthy replica is
   never moved or dropped to improve the global picture. A degraded cluster
   (not Ready, or no gateway address) is still retained - transient outages
   surface via the deployment's conditions, not re-placement. This is what
   makes the scheduler stable: existing placements are inputs, not decisions.

2. Fill. If the deployment wants more replicas than were retained, place the
   shortfall one at a time. Each new replica goes to the eligible cluster
   hosting the fewest of this deployment's replicas (spread first, pack only
   when every eligible cluster already has its share), against a running ledger
   of free node capacity so we never overcommit a cluster. If the deployment
   wants fewer, drop the highest-index replicas first, consolidating off the
   clusters we packed onto last.

Capacity is gated on nodes, not on individual DRA devices. The per-node device
count is a device request's count; the only number the scheduler reads from
topology is nodes-per-replica, which it gates against a pool's available nodes.
Device-count contention BETWEEN deployments is left to DRA admission on the
workload cluster, which is authoritative: it rejects a Pod whose ResourceClaim
can't be satisfied, and the next reconcile sees the updated observed state. The
control-plane scheduler stays deliberately coarse - "could this cluster
plausibly host this replica" - rather than duplicating the real DRA scheduler.

    Returns the resolved claim: DRA DeviceRequests when the pool satisfies every
    request AND at least one matched device is claim: DRA, or None when the pool
    fails any request or matches only synthetic devices.

    A request matches a pool device when the device has enough UNCONSUMED count
    to cover the request and every selector evaluates true against that device.
    Each resolved DRA request becomes a distinct DeviceRequest in one
    ResourceClaim, and DRA allocates distinct devices per request, so a device's
    count is consumed as requests claim it: two requests cannot both be satisfied
    by the same single-count device, and N requests against one device must fit
    within that device's count. This accounting keeps us from accepting a pool
    DRA can't actually satisfy.

    A replica's serving workload binds its GPUs through this ResourceClaim, so a
    pool that matches only synthetic devices (claim: Synthetic, matched for fleet
    scheduling but never claimed) yields nothing to claim and is not a viable
    host. Synthetic devices are co-selectors that refine placement alongside a
    claimable device; a selector that resolves to synthetic devices alone leaves
    the workload with no claim, so we reject the pool. The deployment then finds
    no eligible pool and surfaces InsufficientCapacity. The ModelDeployment XRD
    documents that a nodeSelector must match at least one claimable device.

    Assignment is GREEDY in request order: each request takes the first device
    that satisfies it and has count left, with no backtracking. Greedy is exact
    when no device satisfies two different requests, and that holds for both
    patterns that occur in practice. First, a workload asking for N of one device
    is a single request, so nothing contends. Second, a workload asking for
    different device DOMAINS (e.g. a GPU and a NIC) writes selectors that read
    different attribute domains, so again no device satisfies two requests and
    order can't starve either.

    Greedy can falsely reject only when two requests' match sets OVERLAP on a
    shared device kind - e.g. a broad request (memory >= 80Gi, matches an H100
    and an H200) and a narrow one (an H200 specifically) against a pool holding
    one of each. If the broad request takes the H200 first, the narrow one finds
    nothing and we reject the pool, though broad->H100, narrow->H200 would have
    fit. This needs one deployment to ask for multiple GPUs of deliberately
    different specificity from one mixed-GPU pool, written as overlapping rather
    than disjoint selectors - a shape no real workload writes (you'd name both
    GPUs, or use one request with a count). It also fails SAFE: a false reject
    surfaces as InsufficientCapacity, never an overcommit or a bad placement, and
    the user can resolve it by making the selectors disjoint.
