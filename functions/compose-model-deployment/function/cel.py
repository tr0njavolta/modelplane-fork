"""DRA CEL evaluation for ModelDeployment.nodeSelector.

The design lets an ML team write CEL selectors that the fleet scheduler
evaluates against each candidate pool's devices, in the same dialect a user
would write in a DRA ResourceClaim ([KEP-4381]):

    device.attributes["gpu.nvidia.com"].cudaComputeCapability.isGreaterThan(semver("9.0.0")) &&
    device.capacity["gpu.nvidia.com"].memory.compareTo(quantity("141Gi")) >= 0

This reimplements Kubernetes' DRA device-selector CEL surface
(k8s.io/dynamic-resource-allocation/cel) on top of the pure-Python celpy
evaluator, so an expression that selects a device upstream selects the same
device here. Each selector is evaluated against ONE device, exposed as `device`:

* device.driver                          -> the device's DRA driver (a string)
* device.attributes["<domain>"].<name>   -> a typed attribute under a domain
* device.capacity["<domain>"].<name>     -> a capacity Quantity

Upstream builds the `device` input by splitting each attribute/capacity
QualifiedName into (domain, id): a bare name defaults to the device's driver as
its domain, a "domain/id" name is split on the first "/". A single device can
therefore expose several domains. Looking up an UNKNOWN domain yields an empty
map (upstream's mapper.Find default), not an error; looking up an unknown id
within a domain is an error. We mirror both.

The quantity() and semver() function families live in the sibling `quantity`
and `semver` modules, which match the apiserver CEL libraries those names come
from.

Deliberate divergences we CANNOT match exactly (documented, not bugs):

* Extra base-environment libraries. A DRA selector is compiled against the
  apiserver base CEL env, which also registers URLs, Regex, IP, CIDR, Format,
  Sets, two-variable comprehensions, the apiserver Lists library (isSorted/sum/
  max/min/indexOf/...), and Strings v2. celpy provides the CEL standard macros
  and some of these but not the Kubernetes-specific ones. Selectors that use
  those functions will fail to compile here. Device selectors in practice use
  attribute/capacity comparisons with quantity()/semver(), which we cover.
* List-type attributes and the includes() function (KEP feature-gated,
  DRAListTypeAttributes, ~v1.36). We only model scalar attributes
  (string/bool/int/version), matching the default-off behavior.
* Runtime cost limits. Upstream caps a selector at CELSelectorExpressionMaxCost
  (1,000,000 cost units) and the expression at 10 KiB. celpy has no cost
  accounting, so we don't enforce the cost ceiling (the XRD bounds expression
  length).
* cel.bind / ext.Bindings is available upstream for domain reuse; celpy parses
  cel.bind, so simple uses work, but we don't guarantee parity with the full
  ext.Bindings semantics.
* Output type checking. Upstream rejects a selector that doesn't evaluate to a
  bool at compile time. celpy doesn't expose the output type, so we can't reject
  at compile; instead a non-bool result is treated as a non-match (never a
  truthy coercion), so a stray non-bool selector excludes devices rather than
  spuriously matching them.
* Member vs global call style. celpy dispatches x.method(y) to the function
  method(x, y), so it can't distinguish a member call from a global one. We
  therefore accept both spellings of every function, whereas upstream is strict
  per-overload: quantity()'s sign is a GLOBAL function (sign(q) only; q.sign()
  is a compile error upstream), while compareTo/isGreaterThan/isLessThan are
  member-only. This only makes us MORE permissive (an extra accepted spelling),
  never changing which devices a well-formed selector matches.
* has() on an index. cel-go's has() macro accepts only a field selection
  (has(x.y)), not an index (has(x["y"])), so has(device.attributes["domain"])
  is a compile error upstream; the domain-presence idiom is
  "domain" in device.attributes. celpy accepts the has(index) form too, so
  again we're more permissive. A selector that needs to test domain presence
  should use the in form, which compiles both here and upstream.

Operationally: a device that errors on evaluation (unknown id, malformed
quantity/version, type mismatch) is treated as a non-match rather than failing
the whole reconcile. A malformed expression (compile error) is a user error,
surfaced via CELCompileError.
