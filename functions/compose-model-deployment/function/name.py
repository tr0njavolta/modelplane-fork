"""Derive the identifiers a ModelDeployment uses for its replicas.

One place owns every name a replica's resources are known by, so the
composed ModelReplica, its ModelEndpoint, and the backend workloads all
agree. Two kinds of identifier live here:

* Object names (replica): the metadata.name of a replica's ModelReplica and
  ModelEndpoint - a DNS-label-safe, stable, opaque handle. The replica name is
  also the per-placement routing key baked into the endpoint URL, so both the
  replica and the endpoint must derive it identically.
* Desired-resource keys (replica_key/endpoint_key): function-local handles into
  the desired-resources map. Not Kubernetes names, so they need no DNS-safety -
  they only have to be distinct per co-located replica and deterministic from
  observed state.
