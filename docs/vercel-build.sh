# Build the docs site on Vercel using Nix.
#
# Vercel's build image is fixed (Amazon Linux 2023) and can't be swapped for a
# Nix image, so we install Nix into it and build the same .#docs derivation
# that CI verifies. The build runs as root in an ephemeral container, so we do
# a single-user install with the nixbld build-users group disabled. cache.nixos.org
# supplies almost everything prebuilt, so a cold build is seconds, not minutes.
#
# Vercel runs installCommand and buildCommand as separate shells, so this
# script does both in one place and vercel.json calls it as the buildCommand.

# Pin the Nix installer to an immutable, versioned release rather than the
# rolling nixos.org/nix/install redirect, and verify its SHA-256 before
# running it, so a swapped artifact or a MITM can't get code execution here.
# This script embeds and checks the per-arch tarball hashes itself, so pinning
# it pins the whole install. Bump both together when upgrading Nix:
#   curl -fsSL https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-<ver>/install | sha256sum
