# Getting started

This guide walks through deploying Modelplane on a local kind cluster and using
it to serve a model on GKE. By the end you'll have a working OpenAI-compatible
endpoint serving Qwen 2.5 0.5B.

The whole process takes about 45 minutes. Most of that time is GKE provisioning
the GPU cluster and installing the inference stack. The GKE cluster with an L4
GPU costs roughly $2-3/hr.

## Prerequisites

You need the following tools installed:

- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

You also need:

- A GCP project with the GKE API enabled.
- A GCP service account key (JSON) with permissions to create GKE clusters,
  VPCs, and IAM bindings. The `Editor` role works for trying things out.

## Create a kind cluster

The control plane runs in a local kind cluster. No special configuration is
needed.

```bash
kind create cluster --name modelplane
```

## Install Crossplane

Modelplane is built on [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io) v2. Install it with
Helm:

```bash
helm repo add crossplane-stable https://charts.crossplane.io/stable
helm repo update crossplane-stable
helm install crossplane crossplane-stable/crossplane \
  --namespace crossplane-system --create-namespace \
  --wait
```

## Apply prerequisites

Modelplane needs a few Kubernetes resources that Crossplane can't compose for
itself: a shared namespace, RBAC for Gateway API and MetalLB resources, and a
runtime config for provider-helm.

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<'EOF'
# Shared namespace for Modelplane infrastructure.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: modelplane-system
---
# Grant Crossplane permissions to compose Gateway API, MetalLB, and Usage
# resources. This ClusterRole is aggregated into Crossplane's role automatically.
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1

# Pull secret for Modelplane packages. The package registry requires
# authentication. The pull secret is applied in the next step.
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1beta1

  matchImages:
    - type: Prefix
      prefix: xpkg.upbound.io/negzupboundio/

        name: upbound-pull-secret
EOF
```

## Install Modelplane

Modelplane is packaged as a Crossplane
[Configuration](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/concepts/packages/#configuration-packages).
The package registry requires authentication. Apply the pull secret from the
repo, then install the Configuration. This pulls the providers and composition
functions it depends on.

```bash
kubectl apply -f docs/pull-secret.yaml
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<'EOF'
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: modelplane-infra
spec:
  package: xpkg.upbound.io/negzupboundio/modelplane-infra:v0.1.0-dev.107
EOF
```

Wait for the Configuration and all its dependencies to become healthy. This
pulls several container images and takes 5-10 minutes.

```bash
kubectl get configuration modelplane-infra --watch
# Wait until HEALTHY shows True, then Ctrl-C.
```

## Configure GCP credentials

Create a Secret with your GCP service account key, then create a ProviderConfig
that references it.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic gcp-creds \
  --from-file=credentials=/path/to/sa-key.json \
  -n crossplane-system
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<'EOF'
apiVersion: gcp.m.upbound.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterProviderConfig
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  projectID: my-gcp-project  # Replace with your GCP project ID.
  credentials:
    source: Secret
    secretRef:
      namespace: crossplane-system
      name: gcp-creds
      key: credentials
EOF
```

## Create the InferenceGateway

The InferenceGateway installs Envoy Gateway and MetalLB on the control plane
cluster and creates a Gateway that routes traffic to model placements.

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/platform/inference-gateway.yaml
```

Wait for it to become ready (~3-5 minutes):

```bash
kubectl get ig default --watch
```

## Register a model

Register Qwen 2.5 0.5B in the catalog with serving profiles for both KServe and
Dynamo:

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/platform/cluster-model.yaml
```

## Create an InferenceEnvironment

Edit the example to set your GCP project ID, then apply it:

```bash
# Edit examples/platform/inference-environment-gke-kserve.yaml and set
# spec.kserve.cluster.gke.project to your GCP project ID.
kubectl apply -f examples/platform/inference-environment-gke-kserve.yaml
```

This provisions a GKE cluster with an L4 GPU and installs KServe and its
dependencies. It's the longest step, taking roughly 20-30 minutes.

```bash
kubectl get ie --watch
# Wait until READY shows True, then Ctrl-C.
```

## Deploy a model

Create the `ml-team` namespace and deploy the model:

```bash
kubectl create namespace ml-team
kubectl apply -f examples/deployment/model-deployment.yaml
```

The scheduler matches the model's KServe serving profile to the environment,
checks GPU capacity, and creates a ModelPlacement. Wait for the placement to
become ready:

```bash
kubectl get md -n ml-team --watch
# Wait until READY shows True, then Ctrl-C.
```

## Talk to the model

The gateway endpoint is only reachable from inside the kind Docker network.
Use a pod to send a request:

```bash
kubectl run -i --rm curl-test \
  --image=curlimages/curl \
  --restart=Never \
  -- curl -s http://172.18.255.200/ml-team/qwen-demo/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is Crossplane in one sentence?"}],
    "max_tokens": 100
  }'
```

You can also get the endpoint URL from the ModelDeployment status:

```bash
kubectl get md qwen-demo -n ml-team -o jsonpath='{.status.endpoint.url}'
```

## Clean up

Delete the ModelDeployment before the InferenceEnvironment. If you delete the
environment first, the deployment will be stuck trying to reconcile against an
environment that's being torn down.

Wait for the GKE cluster to be fully deprovisioned before deleting the kind
cluster. If you delete the kind cluster while Crossplane is still cleaning up,
the GKE resources will be orphaned.

```bash
kubectl delete md --all -n ml-team
kubectl delete ie --all

# Wait for the InferenceEnvironment to be fully deleted.
kubectl get ie --watch
# Wait until no resources remain, then Ctrl-C.

kind delete cluster --name modelplane
```
