<!-- vale write-good.Passive = NO -->
An `InferenceClass` is a tested recipe for a GPU node pool. It bundles:


- **Devices**: the node's hardware as a list of Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA)
  style devices, each with a driver, count, typed attributes, and capacity. The
  scheduler matches a member's `nodeSelector` against these devices, and GPUs
  bind to pods through DRA.
- **Provisioning** (optional): how to create a node pool of this class on a
  specific cloud. Classes without provisioning are for existing clusters where
  the pool already exists.

Different clouds and GPU types imply different classes. A GKE L4 pool is
`gke-l4-1x-g2`. A bare-metal H100 pool is `h100-8x-byo` (no provisioning).

## DRA and synthetic devices

Each device sets a `claim` discriminator:

- **`DRA`** (the default) is hardware a real DRA driver exposes, today GPUs.
  Modelplane both schedules against it and binds it to pods.
- **`Synthetic`** is described for scheduling only, never claimed. Use it for
  hardware that matters for placement but has no DRA driver yet, like an
  InfiniBand fabric.

## The device contract

The `driver`, attribute keys, and capacity keys a class declares are a contract
with the ML team: a `ModelDeployment`'s `nodeSelector` matches a pool only if the
class publishes the attributes and capacity it asks for. For GPUs, these keys
should mirror what the DRA driver reports, so the same selector that places a
deployment on the pool also binds the right device.

Publish a device's real usable capacity, not its nominal spec. An `80GB` H100
reports about `81559Mi` of usable memory, so a class that declares `80Gi` would
let a `nodeSelector` asking for `>= 80Gi` match the pool but then fail to bind the
GPU.
