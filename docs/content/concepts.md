Modelplane manages AI model inference across a fleet of GPU clusters. It draws a
boundary between two teams: platform teams who provision infrastructure and
define hardware classes, and ML teams who deploy models and get unified
endpoints.

This page explains the key resources and how they relate.

## InferenceGateway

The InferenceGateway creates a unified, OpenAI-compatible endpoint on the
control plane cluster. It installs [Envoy
Gateway](https://gateway.envoyproxy.io) and creates a Gateway that routes
requests to model endpoints on remote inference clusters.

Create one InferenceGateway per control plane. It must be named `default`. When
running the control plane in kind, set `loadBalancer: MetalLB` to get a
LoadBalancer IP inside the Docker network.

Once ready, read the gateway's external address from the resource's status:

```bash
kubectl get ig default
```

## InferenceClass

An InferenceClass is a tested recipe for a GPU node pool. It bundles:

- **Devices**: the node's hardware as a list of DRA-style devices, each with a
  driver, count, typed attributes, and capacity. A `claim: DRA` device (a GPU) is
  bound to pods through a DRA `ResourceClaim`; a `claim: Synthetic` device (an
  InfiniBand NIC, say) is described for scheduling only. The scheduler matches
  a member's `nodeSelector` against these devices.
- **Provisioning** (optional): how to create a node pool of this class on a
  specific cloud. Classes without provisioning are for existing clusters where
  the pool already exists.

Different clouds and GPU types imply different classes. A GKE L4 pool is
`gke-l4-1x-g2`. A bare-metal H100 pool is `h100-8x-ib` (no provisioning).

## InferenceCluster

An InferenceCluster represents a Kubernetes cluster configured for model
serving. Platform teams create these to provide GPU capacity.

Each cluster has:

- A **cluster source**: `GKE` or `EKS` (Modelplane provisions the full cluster)
  or `Existing` (bring a cluster you manage yourself).
- One or more **node pools**, each referencing an `InferenceClass` for its
  hardware capabilities and provisioning recipe.
- **Labels** for organizational metadata: tier, region, provider. These are the
  matching surface for `ModelDeployment.clusterSelector`.

Modelplane installs an inference stack (e.g. LeaderWorkerSet, llm-d, Dynamo,
Envoy Gateway, etc) on every cluster it manages. This includes existing
clusters, which Modelplane assumes are solely for its use.

## ModelDeployment

A ModelDeployment is the ML team's interface. It carries everything needed to
deploy a model to the fleet: the inference engines, replica count, and an
optional [ModelCache](#modelcache) reference for staged weights.

`spec.engines` is an array of inference engines. An engine is one serving unit:
a single `Standalone` member, or a gang of one `Leader` and one or more `Worker`
members (per `worker.nodes`) coordinating across nodes. Each member carries its
`nodeSelector` (the devices each of its pods needs from its node) and its
`template` (the engine container). A gang's members are usually homogeneous,
repeating the same `nodeSelector`, and the scheduler prefers to place them on
one node pool; a member may omit its `nodeSelector` entirely to claim no devices
(a coordinator-only leader), riding along on its gang's pool. An engine may set
`copies` to run several identical copies - a fixed number, not a scaling knob.
Modelplane is unopinionated about the engine itself: parallelism, quantization,
and KV transfer all live in the members' engine flags, written by you, never
injected by Modelplane.

When you create a ModelDeployment, the scheduler:

1. Discovers all ready InferenceClusters (filtered by `clusterSelector` labels
   if set).
2. Derives each member's node cost: a Standalone or Leader is one pod,
   Workers are `worker.nodes` worker pods, times the engine's `copies`. A
   member that claims no devices costs no nodes.
3. Matches each member's `nodeSelector` device requests against a candidate
   pool's InferenceClass devices, gated on the pool having enough available
   nodes, and co-schedules every member of a replica onto one cluster -
   preferring one pool per engine, splitting members across pools only when no
   pool satisfies them all.
4. Creates a `ModelReplica` for each selected cluster, carrying each member's
   pool and the resolved `claim: DRA` requests so the member's pods form DRA
   `ResourceClaims`.
5. Creates a `ModelEndpoint` for each replica, carrying the URL and rewrite path
   for routing.

A member's `template` is a curated subset of `PodTemplateSpec`. It carries a
single container named `engine`, the inference engine (e.g. vLLM).

### Scaling

ModelDeployment replicas are the top scaling axis. Each `ModelReplica` is a
complete, fixed-shape serving instance. Scaling `spec.replicas` adds or removes
whole instances. There's no in-cluster pod autoscaling.

## Multi-node Inference

When a model is too large to fit on one node's GPUs, make an engine a gang:
give it a `Leader` member and a `Worker` member, whose `worker.nodes` expands
to that many worker pods, one per node. Modelplane composes a LeaderWorkerSet
of pods that serve the model together. The leader runs the engine's
coordination head and serves; the workers join it, addressing the leader
through the `MODELPLANE_LEADER_ADDRESS` env var
Modelplane injects. How the model is split across the gang (tensor, pipeline,
data, or expert parallelism) is up to the engine flags you write on each
member.

Multi-node engines require a [ModelCache](#modelcache) referenced via
`spec.modelCacheRef.name`, since every pod in the gang mounts it.

Disaggregation runs on the multi-node (llm-d) path. A request is routed to a
prefill instance and then to the decode instance holding its KV cache by the
same endpoint picker that fronts multi-node serving. A deployment without a
`prefill` block is unified serving and is unaffected.

Disaggregation pays off for large models under load with strict latency targets
and long context. For small models or low traffic the KV-transfer overhead
outweighs the benefit, so aggregated serving (optionally with chunked prefill)
is the default.

## ModelCache

A ModelCache stages a model artifact on workload-cluster storage as a
first-class resource. Modelplane composes a ReadWriteMany PVC on each matched
cluster and hydrates it once with a Job that fetches the artifact from the
configured source. ModelDeployments reference a cache via
`spec.modelCacheRef.name`; the cache's PVC is mounted at `/mnt/models`
read-write into every serving pod automatically, shared across the LWS gang of
a multi-node engine. The engine reads weights locally from the mount instead of
fetching them at boot.

Without a cache, the engine fetches the model at pod startup, so the
ModelDeployment must supply any required credentials (e.g. `HF_TOKEN` via the
engine container's `env`).

Each cache has:

- A **source**: a required `source` enum naming the kind, with the matching
  source object set alongside it (e.g. `source: HuggingFace` selects
  `spec.huggingFace`, which carries `repo` and `sizeGiB`). `HuggingFace` is the
  only value today; future sources add an enum value and a sibling object
  (`Dragonfly` for P2P distribution, `OCI` for NIM-style bundled artifacts).
- An optional **clusterSelector** to scope replication. Omitting
  `spec.clusterSelector` stages the cache on every matched cluster; setting
  `matchLabels` restricts it to clusters carrying those labels.

The cache mounts at `/mnt/models` on every consuming pod; engine container
args should reference this path (e.g. `--model=/mnt/models` for vLLM).

ModelCache is required for multi-node deployments and optional for single-node
cold-start optimization.

### Storage prerequisites

The cache PVC needs an RWX StorageClass on the workload cluster. What the
platform admin must set up depends on the cloud:

- **GKE:** auto-provisioned. Modelplane composes the `modelplane-rwx` Filestore
  StorageClass and enables `file.googleapis.com`. Nothing for the admin to do.
- **EKS:** bring-your-own for v0.1. On the workload cluster the admin must
  install the `aws-efs-csi-driver` EKS add-on (with an IRSA role bound to
  `AmazonEFSCSIDriverPolicy`); create an EFS file system with a mount target in
  each node subnet and a security group allowing inbound NFS (2049) from the
  node security group; and create a StorageClass named `modelplane-rwx-efs`
  with `provisioner: efs.csi.aws.com`, `provisioningMode: efs-ap`, and
  `fileSystemId: <fs-id>`. Set `eks.cache.storageClassName` if the admin's
  class has a different name. EFS is elastic, so the cache's `sizeGiB` is
  informational on EKS — the PVC API still requires a size, but EFS ignores it.
  Auto-provisioning EFS is tracked in
  [#114](https://github.com/modelplaneai/modelplane/issues/114).

## ModelReplica

The ModelDeployment's composition function creates ModelReplicas. Don't create
them directly.

Each replica represents a model deployed to a specific cluster. It reads the
replica's engines and composes a workload per engine from its member roles: a
native Kubernetes Deployment for a Standalone engine, or an llm-d
LeaderWorkerSet for a Leader/Worker gang. One Service and HTTPRoute, spanning
every engine's serving pods, front the replica as a unified OpenAI-compatible
endpoint.

## ModelEndpoint

A ModelEndpoint is a reachable inference endpoint. Modelplane composes one per
ModelReplica, but ML teams can also create them manually for external SaaS
providers (Together, BaseTen).

Each endpoint composes an Envoy Gateway `Backend` on the control plane.
ModelEndpoint surfaces the Backend's name in `status.routing.backendName` so
ModelService can reference it in its HTTPRoute.

## ModelService

A ModelService exposes one or more ModelEndpoints via a unified, OpenAI-
compatible endpoint. It selects endpoints by label and composes a Gateway API
`HTTPRoute` that load-balances across them.

Each backendRef in the HTTPRoute carries its own `URLRewrite` filter derived
from the endpoint's `spec.rewritePath`, so endpoints from different deployments
or external providers with different path layouts coexist correctly.

Read the service's public address from `status.address`:

```bash
kubectl get ms qwen -n ml-team -o jsonpath='{.status.address}'
```

## Custom Cache Backends

Modelplane provisions Filestore Enterprise on `GKE` clusters and expects a
StorageClass named `modelplane-rwx` on `Existing` clusters (created by the
admin). When the default doesn't fit — different cost profile, an RWX backend
the org already runs, etc. — platform teams point Modelplane at a different
StorageClass via `cluster.<source>.cache.storageClassName`. On GKE the admin
must first create the StorageClass on the workload cluster (any backend
supporting ReadWriteMany dynamic provisioning — WekaIO, NetApp Trident, FSx
for NetApp, and similar). On Existing clusters the field points at whatever
name the admin chose. The ML team's ModelCache and ModelDeployment specs are
unchanged regardless.

Backends that don't fit dynamic-PVC provisioning (e.g. Dragonfly's P2P
distribution to per-node local caches) will be added natively as new types
under `ModelCache.spec.source` rather than through this override.
