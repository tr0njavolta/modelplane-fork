This guide walks through deploying Modelplane on a local kind cluster and using
it to serve a model on GKE. By the end you'll have a working OpenAI-compatible
endpoint serving Qwen 2.5 0.5B.

The whole process takes about 45 minutes. Most of that time is GKE provisioning
the GPU cluster and installing the inference stack. The GKE cluster with an L4
GPU costs roughly $2-3/hr.

## Prerequisites

You need the following tools installed:

- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (or a compatible credential helper) for
  registry authentication.

You also need:

- A GCP project with the GKE API enabled.
- A GCP service account key (JSON) with permissions to create GKE clusters,
  VPCs, and IAM bindings. The `Editor` role works for trying things out.

## Create a kind cluster

The control plane runs in a local kind cluster. It needs no special
configuration.

```bash
kind create cluster --name modelplane
```

## Install Crossplane

Modelplane is built on [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io) v2. Install it with
Helm:

```bash
helm repo add crossplane-stable https://charts.crossplane.io/stable
helm repo update crossplane-stable
helm install crossplane crossplane-stable/crossplane \
  --namespace crossplane-system --create-namespace \
  --wait
```

## Apply prerequisites

Modelplane needs a few Kubernetes resources that Crossplane can't compose for
itself: a shared namespace, RBAC for Gateway API and MetalLB resources, and a
runtime config for provider-helm.

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<'EOF'
# Shared namespace for Modelplane infrastructure.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: modelplane-system
---
# Grant Crossplane permissions to compose Gateway API, MetalLB, and
# Service/EndpointSlice routing resources. This ClusterRole is aggregated
# into Crossplane's role automatically.

metadata:
  name: crossplane-compose-modelplane
  labels:
    rbac.crossplane.io/aggregate-to-crossplane: "true"

# Pull secret for Modelplane packages. The package registry requires
# authentication. The next step applies the pull secret.
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1beta1
kind: ImageConfig

  name: modelplane-pull-secret
spec:
  matchImages:
    - type: Prefix
      prefix: xpkg.upbound.io/modelplane/
  registry:
    authentication:
      pullSecretRef:
        name: upbound-pull-secret
EOF
```

## Install Modelplane

Modelplane is packaged as a Crossplane
[Configuration](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/concepts/packages/#configuration-packages).
The package registry requires authentication. Create a pull secret, then install
the Configuration. This pulls the providers and composition functions it depends
on.

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry upbound-pull-secret \
  --docker-server=xpkg.upbound.io \
  --docker-username='<robot-id>' \
  --docker-password='<robot-token>' \
  -n crossplane-system
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<'EOF'
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: modelplane
spec:
  package: xpkg.upbound.io/modelplane/modelplane:v0.1.0-dev.125.g0cba874
EOF
```

Wait for the Configuration and all its dependencies to become healthy. This
pulls several container images and takes a few minutes.

```bash
kubectl get configuration modelplane --watch
# Wait until HEALTHY shows True, then Ctrl-C.
```

## Configure GCP credentials

Create a Secret with your GCP service account key, then create a ProviderConfig
that references it.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic gcp-creds \
  --from-file=credentials=/path/to/sa-key.json \
  -n crossplane-system
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<'EOF'
apiVersion: gcp.m.upbound.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterProviderConfig
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  projectID: my-gcp-project  # Replace with your GCP project ID.
  credentials:
    source: Secret
    secretRef:
      namespace: crossplane-system
      name: gcp-creds
      key: credentials
EOF
```

## Create the InferenceGateway

The InferenceGateway installs Envoy Gateway and MetalLB on the control plane
cluster and creates a Gateway that routes traffic to model endpoints.

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/platform/inference-gateway.yaml
```

Wait for it to become ready (~3-5 minutes):

```bash
kubectl get ig default --watch
```

## Create an InferenceClass and InferenceCluster

An InferenceClass defines a hardware recipe (GPU type, count, provisioning
config). An InferenceCluster references it to provision GPU node pools.

Apply the L4 InferenceClass, then edit the cluster example to set your GCP
project ID and apply it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/platform/inference-class-gke-l4.yaml
```

```bash
# Edit examples/platform/inference-cluster-gke.yaml and set
# spec.cluster.gke.project to your GCP project ID.
kubectl apply -f examples/platform/inference-cluster-gke.yaml
```

This provisions a GKE cluster with an L4 GPU and installs the inference stack.
It's the longest step, taking roughly 20-30 minutes.

```bash
kubectl get ic --watch
# Wait until READY shows True, then Ctrl-C.
```

## Deploy a model

When a ModelDeployment does **not** reference a ModelCache, the inference engine
fetches model weights directly from the source (e.g. Hugging Face) at pod
startup. The deployment must supply any required credentials via the engine
container's `env` (e.g. `HF_TOKEN`), and the engine image must support fetching
from that source. For large models or frequent restarts, a
[ModelCache](#modelcache) avoids repeated downloads; see `examples/cache/` for
cached single-pod and multi-node deployments.

Create the `ml-team` namespace, deploy the model, and create a ModelService to
expose it:

```bash
kubectl create namespace ml-team
kubectl apply -f examples/deployment/model-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f examples/deployment/model-service.yaml
```

The member's `nodeSelector` declares the GPU its model needs as a DRA device
request (here, a GPU with at least 24Gi of memory). The scheduler matches that
request against each cluster's GPU pools, pins the member to a pool that
satisfies it, and the same request becomes the DRA ResourceClaim the serving
pod binds its GPU through. Wait for the deployment to become ready:

```bash
kubectl get md -n ml-team --watch
# Wait until REPLICAS shows 1, then Ctrl-C.
```

## Talk to the model

The gateway endpoint is only reachable from inside the kind Docker network.
Use a pod to send a request:

```bash
kubectl run -i --rm curl-test \
  --image=curlimages/curl \
  --restart=Never \
  -- curl -s http://172.18.255.200/ml-team/qwen/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is Crossplane in one sentence?"}],
    "max_tokens": 100
  }'
```

You can also get the endpoint URL from the ModelService status:

```bash
kubectl get ms qwen -n ml-team -o jsonpath='{.status.address}'
```

## Clean up

Delete the ModelDeployment before the InferenceCluster. If you delete the
cluster first, the deployment gets stuck reconciling against a cluster
Crossplane is tearing down.

Delete the InferenceCluster with foreground cascading deletion. The inference
stack runs on the workload cluster and must uninstall while that cluster's API
server and kubeconfig still exist. Foreground deletion holds the cluster until
the stack is uninstalled; the default (background) deletion tears everything
down at once, which leaves the stack's Helm releases unable to reach the
cluster and can orphan cloud resources - for example a load balancer's security
group, which then blocks the VPC from deleting.

Wait for the cluster to be fully deprovisioned before deleting the kind
cluster. If you delete the kind cluster while Crossplane is still cleaning up,
Crossplane orphans the cloud resources.

```bash
kubectl delete md --all -n ml-team
kubectl delete ms --all -n ml-team
kubectl delete ic --all --cascade=foreground

# Wait for the InferenceCluster to be fully deleted.
kubectl get ic --watch
# Wait until no resources remain, then Ctrl-C.

kind delete cluster --name modelplane
```
