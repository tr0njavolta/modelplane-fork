A `ModelEndpoint` is a reachable inference endpoint. Modelplane composes one per
`ModelReplica`, but ML teams can also create them manually for external SaaS
providers (Together, BaseTen).

**API:** [`modelplane.ai/v1alpha1` · ModelEndpoint]({{< ref "reference.md" >}}#crd-modelendpoint)

Each endpoint composes an Envoy Gateway `Backend` on the control plane.
`ModelEndpoint` surfaces the Backend's name in `status.routing.backendName` so
`ModelService` can reference it in its HTTPRoute.
