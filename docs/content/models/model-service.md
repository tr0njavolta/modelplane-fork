**API:** [`modelplane.ai/v1alpha1` · ModelService]({{< ref "/reference/modelservices" >}})
<!-- vale write-good.Passive = NO -->
A [`ModelDeployment`]({{< ref "model-deployment.md" >}}) serves a model, but its
replicas are scattered across the fleet with no single address. A `ModelService`
gives them one: a stable, unified, OpenAI-compatible URL that load-balances
across every replica, wherever it runs.

A service selects what to route to by label. Behind the scenes, Modelplane
creates one `ModelEndpoint`, a single reachable backend, for each replica of a
deployment and labels it. Two of those labels carry routing intent:

- `modelplane.ai/deployment`: the deployment the replica belongs to.
- `modelplane.ai/cluster`: the cluster the replica runs on.

Modelplane creates an endpoint only once its replica is Ready, serving and
reachable, and withdraws it if the replica later goes unhealthy. A service only
ever routes to replicas that can actually answer, so a deployment that's still
starting or scaling up has fewer endpoints behind its URL until those replicas
come up. You don't create endpoints yourself. You point a service at them.

`spec.endpoints` is a list, and the entries combine: the service routes to every
endpoint that any entry matches. The patterns below build on that.

## Route to a whole deployment

The common case: one selector matching a deployment's name reaches every replica,
wherever in the fleet they run.

```yaml {nocopy=true}
spec:
  endpoints:
  - selector:
      matchLabels:
        modelplane.ai/deployment: qwen3-8b   # every replica of this deployment
```

## Route to part of a deployment

Add a second label to narrow within a deployment. A selector matches an endpoint
only when all its labels match, so pairing the deployment with a cluster routes to
just that cluster's replicas. This is how you take a cluster out of service
without redeploying: point the service at the clusters you want and leave one out,
and traffic drains to the rest.

```yaml {nocopy=true}
spec:
  endpoints:
  # Only the replicas on prod-us-east, e.g. while draining another cluster.
  - selector:
      matchLabels:
        modelplane.ai/deployment: qwen3-8b
        modelplane.ai/cluster: prod-us-east
```

## Route across several deployments

Give more than one entry to front several deployments behind the same URL. Each
entry contributes its matched endpoints, and traffic spreads evenly across every
one.

```yaml {nocopy=true}
spec:
  endpoints:
  - selector:
      matchLabels:
        modelplane.ai/deployment: qwen3-8b
  - selector:
      matchLabels:
        modelplane.ai/deployment: qwen3-8b-v2
```

This is the shape an A/B test or a canary rollout would take, but note traffic is
split **evenly** across the matched endpoints today. Weighting one entry over
another, to send, say, 5% of traffic to a canary, is tracked in
[#90](https://github.com/modelplaneai/modelplane/issues/90). Until then the split
follows endpoint counts, not a ratio you set.

The entries don't have to be deployments. One can select a manually created
[ModelEndpoint]({{< ref "model-endpoint.md" >}}) that points at an external
provider, so a service can send overflow or break-glass traffic to a SaaS
endpoint alongside your own replicas:

```yaml {nocopy=true}
spec:
  endpoints:
  - selector:
      matchLabels:
        modelplane.ai/deployment: kimi-k2
  - selector:
      matchLabels:
        modelplane.ai/external-provider: together
```

Endpoints with different path layouts coexist behind the one URL.

## Sending a request

The service's public address is on `status.address`, in the form
`http://<gateway>/<namespace>/<service-name>`:

```bash
ADDRESS=$(kubectl get ms qwen -n ml-team -o jsonpath='{.status.address}')
```

Append the OpenAI path and send a request. The `model` field is the name the
engine serves (its `--served-model-name`, or the model's Hugging Face id if you
didn't set one):

```bash
curl "$ADDRESS/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

## Alternate APIs

We call the endpoint OpenAI-compatible because the engines are, not because
Modelplane imposes it. The route matches the `/<namespace>/<service>/` prefix and
preserves the path below it on the way to the engine, so any API the engine serves
is reachable on the same URL.

Take a vLLM replica that also serves the Anthropic Messages API. It answers on
`.../v1/messages`, so a client that speaks it (including Claude Code, via
`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) talks to it directly. The engine's operational paths come
through the same way: `.../health` and the Prometheus `.../metrics` are reachable
on the service URL.

There's one exception, and it's set by the deployment rather than the service.
[Disaggregated serving]({{< ref "model-deployment.md#disaggregated-serving" >}})
reads OpenAI-format request bodies to pick a prefill and decode worker, so a
request in another API shape still reaches the engine but skips that
cache-aware routing. Unified serving forwards every API shape the same way.
