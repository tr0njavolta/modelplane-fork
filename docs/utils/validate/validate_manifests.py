"""Validate docs example manifests against the generated Pydantic models.

Every Modelplane manifest the docs show — the raw YAML files under
docs/manifests/, including the API-reference examples under
docs/manifests/reference/ — is parsed and validated against the model generated
from its XRD, before it reaches the published docs.

Validation runs the models in strict mode: extra="forbid" at every nesting
level. So beyond the usual checks (a missing required field, a wrong type, a bad
enum or a failed pattern), this also rejects a field the schema doesn't define —
a typo, or a field the API renamed or dropped. An example can't carry anything
the current API wouldn't accept. The flip side: if the model generator ever
dropped a field the API still has, a valid manifest using it would fail here and
flag the gap, which is the behaviour we want.

Only Modelplane's own API groups have generated models, so resources from other
groups (provider ClusterProviderConfigs, core Namespaces, RBAC, Crossplane
packages) are skipped — they aren't ours to validate here.
